AppConfig supports controlled deployments to applications of any size and includes built-in validation checks and monitoring. You can use AppConfig with applications hosted on Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices. To prevent errors when deploying application configurations, especially for production systems where a simple typo could cause an unexpected outage, AppConfig includes validators. A validator provides a syntactic or semantic check to ensure that the configuration you want to deploy works as intended. To validate your application configuration data, you provide a schema or a Lambda function that runs against the configuration. The configuration deployment or update can only proceed when the configuration data is valid. During a configuration deployment, AppConfig monitors the application to ensure that the deployment is successful. If the system encounters an error, AppConfig rolls back the change to minimize impact for your application users. You can configure a deployment strategy for each application or environment that includes deployment criteria, including velocity, bake time, and alarms to monitor. Similar to error monitoring, if a deployment triggers an alarm, AppConfig automatically rolls back to the previous version. AppConfig supports multiple use cases. Here are some examples. Application tuning : Use AppConfig to carefully introduce changes to your application that can only be tested with production traffic. Feature toggle : Use AppConfig to turn on new features that require a timely deployment, such as a product launch or announcement. Allow list : Use AppConfig to allow premium subscribers to access paid content. Operational issues : Use AppConfig to reduce stress on your application when a dependency or other external factor impacts the system.

      "description": "AWS CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository compatible with language-native package managers and build tools such as npm, Apache Maven, and pip. You can use CodeArtifact to share packages with development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream relationship between a CodeArtifact repository and another repository, which effectively merges their contents from the point of view of a package manager client. AWS CodeArtifact Components Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following CodeArtifact components: Repository : A CodeArtifact repository contains a set of package versions, each of which maps to a set of assets, or files. Repositories are polyglot, so a single repository can contain packages of any supported type. Each repository exposes endpoints for fetching and publishing packages using tools like the npm CLI, the Maven CLI ( mvn ), and pip . Domain : Repositories are aggregated into a higher-level entity known as a domain. All package assets and metadata are stored in the domain, but are consumed through repositories. A given package asset, such as a Maven JAR file, is stored once per domain, no matter how many repositories it's present in. All of the assets and metadata in a domain are encrypted with the same customer master key (CMK) stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Each repository is a member of a single domain and can't be moved to a different domain. The domain allows organizational policy to be applied across multiple repositories, such as which accounts can access repositories in the domain, and which public repositories can be used as sources of packages. Although an organization can have multiple domains, we recommend a single production domain that contains all published artifacts so that teams can find and share packages across their organization. Package : A package is a bundle of software and the metadata required to resolve dependencies and install the software. CodeArtifact supports npm, PyPI, and Maven package formats. In CodeArtifact, a package consists of: A name (for example, webpack is the name of a popular npm package) An optional namespace (for example, @types in @types/node) A set of versions (for example, 1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.) Package-level metadata (for example, npm tags) Package version : A version of a package, such as @types/node 12.6.9. The version number format and semantics vary for different package formats. For example, npm package versions must conform to the Semantic Versioning specification. In CodeArtifact, a package version consists of the version identifier, metadata at the package version level, and a set of assets. Upstream repository : One repository is upstream of another when the package versions in it can be accessed from the repository endpoint of the downstream repository, effectively merging the contents of the two repositories from the point of view of a client. CodeArtifact allows creating an upstream relationship between two repositories. Asset : An individual file stored in CodeArtifact associated with a package version, such as an npm.tgz file or Maven POM and JAR files. CodeArtifact supports these operations: AssociateExternalConnection : Adds an existing external connection to a repository. CopyPackageVersions : Copies package versions from one repository to another repository in the same domain. CreateDomain : Creates a domain CreateRepository : Creates a CodeArtifact repository in a domain. DeleteDomain : Deletes a domain. You cannot delete a domain that contains repositories. DeleteDomainPermissionsPolicy : Deletes the resource policy that is set on a domain. DeletePackageVersions : Deletes versions of a package. After a package has been deleted, it can be republished, but its assets and metadata cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage. DeleteRepository : Deletes a repository. DeleteRepositoryPermissionsPolicy : Deletes the resource policy that is set on a repository. DescribeDomain : Returns a DomainDescription object that contains information about the requested domain. DescribePackageVersion : Returns a PackageVersionDescription object that contains details about a package version. DescribeRepository : Returns a RepositoryDescription object that contains detailed information about the requested repository. DisposePackageVersions : Disposes versions of a package. A package version with the status Disposed cannot be restored because they have been permanently removed from storage. DisassociateExternalConnection : Removes an existing external connection from a repository. GetAuthorizationToken : Generates a temporary authorization token for accessing repositories in the domain. The token expires the authorization period has passed. The default authorization period is 12 hours and can be customized to any length with a maximum of 12 hours. GetDomainPermissionsPolicy : Returns the policy of a resource that is attached to the specified domain. GetPackageVersionAsset : Returns the contents of an asset that is in a package version. GetPackageVersionReadme : Gets the readme file or descriptive text for a package version. GetRepositoryEndpoint : Returns the endpoint of a repository for a specific package format. A repository has one endpoint for each package format: npm pypi maven GetRepositoryPermissionsPolicy : Returns the resource policy that is set on a repository. ListDomains : Returns a list of DomainSummary objects. Each returned DomainSummary object contains information about a domain. ListPackages : Lists the packages in a repository. ListPackageVersionAssets : Lists the assets for a given package version. ListPackageVersionDependencies : Returns a list of the direct dependencies for a package version. ListPackageVersions : Returns a list of package versions for a specified package in a repository. ListRepositories : Returns a list of repositories owned by the AWS account that called this method. ListRepositoriesInDomain : Returns a list of the repositories in a domain. PutDomainPermissionsPolicy : Attaches a resource policy to a domain. PutRepositoryPermissionsPolicy : Sets the resource policy on a repository that specifies permissions to access it. UpdatePackageVersionsStatus : Updates the status of one or more versions of a package. UpdateRepository : Updates the properties of a repository.",

      "description": "AWS CodeDeploy AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your own facility, serverless AWS Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon ECS service. You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated Lambda function, updated applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. AWS CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes to your existing code before you can use AWS CodeDeploy. AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating your applications, without many of the risks associated with error-prone manual deployments. AWS CodeDeploy Components Use the information in this guide to help you work with the following AWS CodeDeploy components: Application : A name that uniquely identifies the application you want to deploy. AWS CodeDeploy uses this name, which functions as a container, to ensure the correct combination of revision, deployment configuration, and deployment group are referenced during a deployment. Deployment group : A set of individual instances, CodeDeploy Lambda deployment configuration settings, or an Amazon ECS service and network details. A Lambda deployment group specifies how to route traffic to a new version of a Lambda function. An Amazon ECS deployment group specifies the service created in Amazon ECS to deploy, a load balancer, and a listener to reroute production traffic to an updated containerized application. An EC2/On-premises deployment group contains individually tagged instances, Amazon EC2 instances in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, or both. All deployment groups can specify optional trigger, alarm, and rollback settings. Deployment configuration : A set of deployment rules and deployment success and failure conditions used by AWS CodeDeploy during a deployment. Deployment : The process and the components used when updating a Lambda function, a containerized application in an Amazon ECS service, or of installing content on one or more instances. Application revisions : For an AWS Lambda deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Lambda function to be updated and one or more functions to validate deployment lifecycle events. For an Amazon ECS deployment, this is an AppSpec file that specifies the Amazon ECS task definition, container, and port where production traffic is rerouted. For an EC2/On-premises deployment, this is an archive file that contains source content—source code, webpages, executable files, and deployment scripts—along with an AppSpec file. Revisions are stored in Amazon S3 buckets or GitHub repositories. For Amazon S3, a revision is uniquely identified by its Amazon S3 object key and its ETag, version, or both. For GitHub, a revision is uniquely identified by its commit ID. This guide also contains information to help you get details about the instances in your deployments, to make on-premises instances available for AWS CodeDeploy deployments, to get details about a Lambda function deployment, and to get details about Amazon ECS service deployments.

Some functionality for your pipeline can only be configured through the API. For more information, see the AWS CodePipeline User Guide. You can use the AWS CodePipeline API to work with pipelines, stages, actions, and transitions. Pipelines are models of automated release processes. Each pipeline is uniquely named, and consists of stages, actions, and transitions. You can work with pipelines by calling: CreatePipeline, which creates a uniquely named pipeline. DeletePipeline, which deletes the specified pipeline. GetPipeline, which returns information about the pipeline structure and pipeline metadata, including the pipeline Amazon Resource Name (ARN). GetPipelineExecution, which returns information about a specific execution of a pipeline. GetPipelineState, which returns information about the current state of the stages and actions of a pipeline. ListActionExecutions, which returns action-level details for past executions. The details include full stage and action-level details, including individual action duration, status, any errors that occurred during the execution, and input and output artifact location details. ListPipelines, which gets a summary of all of the pipelines associated with your account. ListPipelineExecutions, which gets a summary of the most recent executions for a pipeline. StartPipelineExecution, which runs the most recent revision of an artifact through the pipeline. StopPipelineExecution, which stops the specified pipeline execution from continuing through the pipeline. UpdatePipeline, which updates a pipeline with edits or changes to the structure of the pipeline. Pipelines include stages. Each stage contains one or more actions that must complete before the next stage begins. A stage results in success or failure. If a stage fails, the pipeline stops at that stage and remains stopped until either a new version of an artifact appears in the source location, or a user takes action to rerun the most recent artifact through the pipeline. You can call GetPipelineState, which displays the status of a pipeline, including the status of stages in the pipeline, or GetPipeline, which returns the entire structure of the pipeline, including the stages of that pipeline. For more information about the structure of stages and actions, see AWS CodePipeline Pipeline Structure Reference. Pipeline stages include actions that are categorized into categories such as source or build actions performed in a stage of a pipeline. For example, you can use a source action to import artifacts into a pipeline from a source such as Amazon S3. Like stages, you do not work with actions directly in most cases, but you do define and interact with actions when working with pipeline operations such as CreatePipeline and GetPipelineState. Valid action categories are: Source Build Test Deploy Approval Invoke Pipelines also include transitions, which allow the transition of artifacts from one stage to the next in a pipeline after the actions in one stage complete. You can work with transitions by calling: DisableStageTransition, which prevents artifacts from transitioning to the next stage in a pipeline. EnableStageTransition, which enables transition of artifacts between stages in a pipeline. Using the API to integrate with AWS CodePipeline For third-party integrators or developers who want to create their own integrations with AWS CodePipeline, the expected sequence varies from the standard API user. To integrate with AWS CodePipeline, developers need to work with the following items: Jobs, which are instances of an action. For example, a job for a source action might import a revision of an artifact from a source. You can work with jobs by calling: AcknowledgeJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job. GetJobDetails, which returns the details of a job. PollForJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on. PutJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure. PutJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success. Third party jobs, which are instances of an action created by a partner action and integrated into AWS CodePipeline. Partner actions are created by members of the AWS Partner Network. You can work with third party jobs by calling: AcknowledgeThirdPartyJob, which confirms whether a job worker has received the specified job. GetThirdPartyJobDetails, which requests the details of a job for a partner action. PollForThirdPartyJobs, which determines whether there are any jobs to act on. PutThirdPartyJobFailureResult, which provides details of a job failure. PutThirdPartyJobSuccessResult, which provides details of a job success.",

You can use the connections API to work with connections and installations. Connections are configurations that you use to connect AWS resources to external code repositories. Each connection is a resource that can be given to services such as CodePipeline to connect to a third-party repository such as Bitbucket. For example, you can add the connection in CodePipeline so that it triggers your pipeline when a code change is made to your third-party code repository. Each connection is named and associated with a unique ARN that is used to reference the connection. When you create a connection, the console initiates a third-party connection handshake. Installations are the apps that are used to conduct this handshake. For example, the installation for the Bitbucket provider type is the Bitbucket app. When you create a connection, you can choose an existing installation or create one. When you want to create a connection to an installed provider type such as GitHub Enterprise Server, you create a host for your connections. You can work with connections by calling: CreateConnection, which creates a uniquely named connection that can be referenced by services such as CodePipeline. DeleteConnection, which deletes the specified connection. GetConnection, which returns information about the connection, including the connection status. ListConnections, which lists the connections associated with your account. You can work with hosts by calling: CreateHost, which creates a host that represents the infrastructure where your provider is installed. DeleteHost, which deletes the specified host. GetHost, which returns information about the host, including the setup status. ListHosts, which lists the hosts associated with your account. You can work with tags in AWS CodeStar Connections by calling the following: ListTagsForResource, which gets information about AWS tags for a specified Amazon Resource Name (ARN) in AWS CodeStar Connections. TagResource, which adds or updates tags for a resource in AWS CodeStar Connections. UntagResource, which removes tags for a resource in AWS CodeStar Connections. For information about how to use AWS CodeStar Connections, see the Developer Tools User Guide.",

      "description": "AWS Application Discovery Service AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects. It automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your on-premises data centers. For more information, see the AWS Application Discovery Service FAQ. Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and collecting data about your on-premises servers: Agentless discovery is recommended for environments that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each host. It does not work in non-VMware environments. Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure assessment. Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about network dependencies, only agent-based discovery collects that information. Agent-based discovery collects a richer set of data than agentless discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install on one or more hosts in your data center. The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an inventory of running processes, system performance information, resource utilization, and network dependencies. The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the Application Discovery Service database in the cloud. AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions integrate with Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your on-premises environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or discovery agent. Third-party application discovery tools can query AWS Application Discovery Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database using the public API. In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can associate applications with servers and track migrations. Recommendations We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and whenever you want to collect information about network dependencies. You can run agent-based and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to complete the initial infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to collect additional information. Working With This Guide This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs. Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home region before you call any of these APIs. You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate, import, or put) while in your home region, or a HomeRegionNotSetException error is returned. API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside of your home region. Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could change. If you call APIs outside the home region, an InvalidInputException is returned. You must call GetHomeRegion to obtain the latest Migration Hub home region. This guide is intended for use with the AWS Application Discovery Service User Guide. All data is handled according to the AWS Privacy Policy. You can operate Application Discovery Service offline to inspect collected data before it is shared with the service.",

      "description": "Elastic Load Balancing A load balancer can distribute incoming traffic across your EC2 instances. This enables you to increase the availability of your application. The load balancer also monitors the health of its registered instances and ensures that it routes traffic only to healthy instances. You configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifying one or more listeners, which are configured with a protocol and port number for connections from clients to the load balancer and a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the instances. Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. You can select a load balancer based on your application needs. For more information, see the Elastic Load Balancing User Guide. This reference covers the 2012-06-01 API, which supports Classic Load Balancers. The 2015-12-01 API supports Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. To get started, create a load balancer with one or more listeners using CreateLoadBalancer. Register your instances with the load balancer using RegisterInstancesWithLoadBalancer. All Elastic Load Balancing operations are idempotent, which means that they complete at most one time. If you repeat an operation, it succeeds with a 200 OK response code.",

      "description": "AWS Global Accelerator This is the AWS Global Accelerator API Reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about AWS Global Accelerator API actions, data types, and errors. For more information about Global Accelerator features, see the AWS Global Accelerator Developer Guide. AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve the performance of your applications for local and global users. Depending on the type of accelerator you choose, you can gain additional benefits. By using a standard accelerator, you can improve availability of your internet applications that are used by a global audience. With a standard accelerator, Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network. For other scenarios, you might choose a custom routing accelerator. With a custom routing accelerator, you can use application logic to directly map one or more users to a specific endpoint among many endpoints. Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple AWS Regions but you must specify the US West (Oregon) Region to create or update accelerators. By default, Global Accelerator provides you with two static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator. With a standard accelerator, instead of using the IP addresses that Global Accelerator provides, you can configure these entry points to be IPv4 addresses from your own IP address ranges that you bring to Global Accelerator. The static IP addresses are anycast from the AWS edge network. For a standard accelerator, they distribute incoming application traffic across multiple endpoint resources in multiple AWS Regions, which increases the availability of your applications. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses that are located in one AWS Region or multiple Regions. For custom routing accelerators, you map traffic that arrives to the static IP addresses to specific Amazon EC2 servers in endpoints that are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets. The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information, see Tag-based policies. For standard accelerators, Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network to route traffic to the optimal regional endpoint based on health, client location, and policies that you configure. The service reacts instantly to changes in health or configuration to ensure that internet traffic from clients is always directed to healthy endpoints. For a list of the AWS Regions where Global Accelerator and other services are currently supported, see the AWS Region Table. AWS Global Accelerator includes the following components: Static IP addresses Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses that are anycast from the AWS edge network. If you bring your own IP address range to AWS (BYOIP) to use with a standard accelerator, you can instead assign IP addresses from your own pool to use with your accelerator. For more information, see Bring your own IP addresses (BYOIP) in AWS Global Accelerator. The IP addresses serve as single fixed entry points for your clients. If you already have Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP address resources set up for your applications, you can easily add those to a standard accelerator in Global Accelerator. This allows Global Accelerator to use static IP addresses to access the resources. The static IP addresses remain assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you delete an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to it, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. You can use IAM policies like tag-based permissions with Global Accelerator to delete an accelerator. For more information, see Tag-based policies. Accelerator An accelerator directs traffic to endpoints over the AWS global network to improve the performance of your internet applications. Each accelerator includes one or more listeners. There are two types of accelerators: A standard accelerator directs traffic to the optimal AWS endpoint based on several factors, including the user’s location, the health of the endpoint, and the endpoint weights that you configure. This improves the availability and performance of your applications. Endpoints can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. A custom routing accelerator directs traffic to one of possibly thousands of Amazon EC2 instances running in a single or multiple virtual private clouds (VPCs). With custom routing, listener ports are mapped to statically associate port ranges with VPC subnets, which allows Global Accelerator to determine an EC2 instance IP address at the time of connection. By default, all port mapping destinations in a VPC subnet can't receive traffic. You can choose to configure all destinations in the subnet to receive traffic, or to specify individual port mappings that can receive traffic. For more information, see Types of accelerators. DNS name Global Accelerator assigns each accelerator a default Domain Name System (DNS) name, similar to a1234567890abcdef.awsglobalaccelerator.com, that points to the static IP addresses that Global Accelerator assigns to you or that you choose from your own IP address range. Depending on the use case, you can use your accelerator's static IP addresses or DNS name to route traffic to your accelerator, or set up DNS records to route traffic using your own custom domain name. Network zone A network zone services the static IP addresses for your accelerator from a unique IP subnet. Similar to an AWS Availability Zone, a network zone is an isolated unit with its own set of physical infrastructure. When you configure an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator allocates two IPv4 addresses for it. If one IP address from a network zone becomes unavailable due to IP address blocking by certain client networks, or network disruptions, then client applications can retry on the healthy static IP address from the other isolated network zone. Listener A listener processes inbound connections from clients to Global Accelerator, based on the port (or port range) and protocol (or protocols) that you configure. A listener can be configured for TCP, UDP, or both TCP and UDP protocols. Each listener has one or more endpoint groups associated with it, and traffic is forwarded to endpoints in one of the groups. You associate endpoint groups with listeners by specifying the Regions that you want to distribute traffic to. With a standard accelerator, traffic is distributed to optimal endpoints within the endpoint groups associated with a listener. Endpoint group Each endpoint group is associated with a specific AWS Region. Endpoint groups include one or more endpoints in the Region. With a standard accelerator, you can increase or reduce the percentage of traffic that would be otherwise directed to an endpoint group by adjusting a setting called a traffic dial. The traffic dial lets you easily do performance testing or blue/green deployment testing, for example, for new releases across different AWS Regions. Endpoint An endpoint is a resource that Global Accelerator directs traffic to. Endpoints for standard accelerators can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. An Application Load Balancer endpoint can be internet-facing or internal. Traffic for standard accelerators is routed to endpoints based on the health of the endpoint along with configuration options that you choose, such as endpoint weights. For each endpoint, you can configure weights, which are numbers that you can use to specify the proportion of traffic to route to each one. This can be useful, for example, to do performance testing within a Region. Endpoints for custom routing accelerators are virtual private cloud (VPC) subnets with one or many EC2 instances.",

You can use the API operations to get information about AWS Health events that affect your AWS services and resources. You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan from AWS Support to use the AWS Health API. If you call the AWS Health API from an AWS account that doesn't have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, you receive a SubscriptionRequiredException error. You can use the AWS Health endpoint health.us-east-1.amazonaws.com (HTTPS) to call the AWS Health API operations. AWS Health supports a multi-Region application architecture and has two regional endpoints in an active-passive configuration. You can use the high availability endpoint example to determine which AWS Region is active, so that you can get the latest information from the API. For more information, see Accessing the AWS Health API in the AWS Health User Guide. For authentication of requests, AWS Health uses the Signature Version 4 Signing Process. If your AWS account is part of AWS Organizations, you can use the AWS Health organizational view feature. This feature provides a centralized view of AWS Health events across all accounts in your organization. You can aggregate AWS Health events in real time to identify accounts in your organization that are affected by an operational event or get notified of security vulnerabilities. Use the organizational view API operations to enable this feature and return event information. For more information, see Aggregating AWS Health events in the AWS Health User Guide. When you use the AWS Health API operations to return AWS Health events, see the following recommendations: Use the eventScopeCode parameter to specify whether to return AWS Health events that are public or account-specific. Use pagination to view all events from the response. For example, if you call the DescribeEventsForOrganization operation to get all events in your organization, you might receive several page results.

      "description": "IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data, process messages, and store them. You can then query the data and run sophisticated analytics on it. IoT Analytics enables advanced data exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration with Amazon QuickSight. Traditional analytics and business intelligence tools are designed to process structured data. IoT data often comes from devices that record noisy processes (such as temperature, motion, or sound). As a result the data from these devices can have significant gaps, corrupted messages, and false readings that must be cleaned up before analysis can occur. Also, IoT data is often only meaningful in the context of other data from external sources. IoT Analytics automates the steps required to analyze data from IoT devices. IoT Analytics filters, transforms, and enriches IoT data before storing it in a time-series data store for analysis. You can set up the service to collect only the data you need from your devices, apply mathematical transforms to process the data, and enrich the data with device-specific metadata such as device type and location before storing it. Then, you can analyze your data by running queries using the built-in SQL query engine, or perform more complex analytics and machine learning inference. IoT Analytics includes pre-built models for common IoT use cases so you can answer questions like which devices are about to fail or which customers are at risk of abandoning their wearable devices.",

      "slug": "amazonawscom-ivs",
      "version": "2020-07-14",
      "description": "Introduction The Amazon Interactive Video Service (IVS) API is REST compatible, using a standard HTTP API and an AWS EventBridge event stream for responses. JSON is used for both requests and responses, including errors. The API is an AWS regional service, currently in these regions: us-west-2, us-east-1, and eu-west-1. All API request parameters and URLs are case sensitive. For a summary of notable documentation changes in each release, see Document History. Service Endpoints The following are the Amazon IVS service endpoints (all HTTPS): Region name: US West (Oregon) Region: us-west-2 Endpoint: ivs.us-west-2.amazonaws.com Region name: US East (Virginia) Region: us-east-1 Endpoint: ivs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Region name: EU West (Dublin) Region: eu-west-1 Endpoint: ivs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com Allowed Header Values Accept: application/json Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Content-Type: application/json Resources The following resources contain information about your IVS live stream (see Getting Started with Amazon IVS): Channel — Stores configuration data related to your live stream. You first create a channel and then use the channel’s stream key to start your live stream. See the Channel endpoints for more information. Stream key — An identifier assigned by Amazon IVS when you create a channel, which is then used to authorize streaming. See the StreamKey endpoints for more information. Treat the stream key like a secret, since it allows anyone to stream to the channel. Playback key pair — Video playback may be restricted using playback-authorization tokens, which use public-key encryption. A playback key pair is the public-private pair of keys used to sign and validate the playback-authorization token. See the PlaybackKeyPair endpoints for more information. Recording configuration — Stores configuration related to recording a live stream and where to store the recorded content. Multiple channels can reference the same recording configuration. See the Recording Configuration endpoints for more information. Tagging A tag is a metadata label that you assign to an AWS resource. A tag comprises a key and a value, both set by you. For example, you might set a tag as topic:nature to label a particular video category. See Tagging AWS Resources for more information, including restrictions that apply to tags. Tags can help you identify and organize your AWS resources. For example, you can use the same tag for different resources to indicate that they are related. You can also use tags to manage access (see Access Tags). The Amazon IVS API has these tag-related endpoints: TagResource, UntagResource, and ListTagsForResource. The following resources support tagging: Channels, Stream Keys, Playback Key Pairs, and Recording Configurations. Authentication versus Authorization Note the differences between these concepts: Authentication is about verifying identity. You need to be authenticated to sign Amazon IVS API requests. Authorization is about granting permissions. You need to be authorized to view Amazon IVS private channels. (Private channels are channels that are enabled for \"playback authorization.\") Authentication All Amazon IVS API requests must be authenticated with a signature. The AWS Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Amazon IVS Player SDKs take care of signing the underlying API calls for you. However, if your application calls the Amazon IVS API directly, it’s your responsibility to sign the requests. You generate a signature using valid AWS credentials that have permission to perform the requested action. For example, you must sign PutMetadata requests with a signature generated from an IAM user account that has the ivs:PutMetadata permission. For more information: Authentication and generating signatures — See Authenticating Requests (AWS Signature Version 4) in the AWS General Reference. Managing Amazon IVS permissions — See Identity and Access Management on the Security page of the Amazon IVS User Guide. Channel Endpoints CreateChannel — Creates a new channel and an associated stream key to start streaming. GetChannel — Gets the channel configuration for the specified channel ARN (Amazon Resource Name). BatchGetChannel — Performs GetChannel on multiple ARNs simultaneously. ListChannels — Gets summary information about all channels in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed. This list can be filtered to match a specified name or recording-configuration ARN. Filters are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together. If you try to use both filters, you will get an error (409 Conflict Exception). UpdateChannel — Updates a channel's configuration. This does not affect an ongoing stream of this channel. You must stop and restart the stream for the changes to take effect. DeleteChannel — Deletes the specified channel. StreamKey Endpoints CreateStreamKey — Creates a stream key, used to initiate a stream, for the specified channel ARN. GetStreamKey — Gets stream key information for the specified ARN. BatchGetStreamKey — Performs GetStreamKey on multiple ARNs simultaneously. ListStreamKeys — Gets summary information about stream keys for the specified channel. DeleteStreamKey — Deletes the stream key for the specified ARN, so it can no longer be used to stream. Stream Endpoints GetStream — Gets information about the active (live) stream on a specified channel. ListStreams — Gets summary information about live streams in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed. StopStream — Disconnects the incoming RTMPS stream for the specified channel. Can be used in conjunction with DeleteStreamKey to prevent further streaming to a channel. PutMetadata — Inserts metadata into the active stream of the specified channel. A maximum of 5 requests per second per channel is allowed, each with a maximum 1 KB payload. (If 5 TPS is not sufficient for your needs, we recommend batching your data into a single PutMetadata call.) PlaybackKeyPair Endpoints For more information, see Setting Up Private Channels in the Amazon IVS User Guide. ImportPlaybackKeyPair — Imports the public portion of a new key pair and returns its arn and fingerprint. The privateKey can then be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to private channels (channels enabled for playback authorization). GetPlaybackKeyPair — Gets a specified playback authorization key pair and returns the arn and fingerprint. The privateKey held by the caller can be used to generate viewer authorization tokens, to grant viewers access to private channels. ListPlaybackKeyPairs — Gets summary information about playback key pairs. DeletePlaybackKeyPair — Deletes a specified authorization key pair. This invalidates future viewer tokens generated using the key pair’s privateKey. RecordingConfiguration Endpoints CreateRecordingConfiguration — Creates a new recording configuration, used to enable recording to Amazon S3. GetRecordingConfiguration — Gets the recording-configuration metadata for the specified ARN. ListRecordingConfigurations — Gets summary information about all recording configurations in your account, in the AWS region where the API request is processed. DeleteRecordingConfiguration — Deletes the recording configuration for the specified ARN. AWS Tags Endpoints TagResource — Adds or updates tags for the AWS resource with the specified ARN. UntagResource — Removes tags from the resource with the specified ARN. ListTagsForResource — Gets information about AWS tags for the specified ARN.",

For general information about KMS, see the Key Management Service Developer Guide . KMS is replacing the term customer master key (CMK) with KMS key and KMS key. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term. Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services. We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS. Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes. Signing Requests Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your Amazon Web Services account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user. You can also use the Amazon Web Services Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests. All KMS operations require Signature Version 4. Logging API Requests KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the CloudTrail User Guide. Additional Resources For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following: Amazon Web Services Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used to access Amazon Web Services. Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials. Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key. Commonly Used API Operations Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform operations other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console. Encrypt Decrypt GenerateDataKey GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext",

For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as \"NullReferenceException\") or count the number of occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as \"404\" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify. Monitor CloudTrail logged events : You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification to perform troubleshooting. Archive log data : You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so that any log events older than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.",

AWS Marketplace sellers can use this API to submit usage data for custom usage dimensions. For information on the permissions you need to use this API, see AWS Marketing metering and entitlement API permissions in the AWS Marketplace Seller Guide. Submitting Metering Records MeterUsage - Submits the metering record for a Marketplace product. MeterUsage is called from an EC2 instance or a container running on EKS or ECS. BatchMeterUsage - Submits the metering record for a set of customers. BatchMeterUsage is called from a software-as-a-service (SaaS) application. Accepting New Customers ResolveCustomer - Called by a SaaS application during the registration process. When a buyer visits your website during the registration process, the buyer submits a Registration Token through the browser. The Registration Token is resolved through this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier and Product Code. Entitlement and Metering for Paid Container Products Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage operation for software entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage, but you can do so if you want to receive usage data in your seller reports. For more information on using the RegisterUsage operation, see Container-Based Products. BatchMeterUsage API calls are captured by AWS CloudTrail. You can use Cloudtrail to verify that the SaaS metering records that you sent are accurate by searching for records with the eventName of BatchMeterUsage. You can also use CloudTrail to audit records over time. For more information, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide .",

The REST API requires you to handle connection details, such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. For general information about using the AWS REST APIs, see AWS APIs. To access Network Firewall using the REST API endpoint: https://network-firewall..amazonaws.com Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see AWS SDKs. For descriptions of Network Firewall features, including and step-by-step instructions on how to use them through the Network Firewall console, see the Network Firewall Developer Guide. Network Firewall is a stateful, managed, network firewall and intrusion detection and prevention service for Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). With Network Firewall, you can filter traffic at the perimeter of your VPC. This includes filtering traffic going to and coming from an internet gateway, NAT gateway, or over VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Network Firewall uses rules that are compatible with Suricata, a free, open source intrusion detection system (IDS) engine. For information about Suricata, see the Suricata website. You can use Network Firewall to monitor and protect your VPC traffic in a number of ways. The following are just a few examples: Allow domains or IP addresses for known AWS service endpoints, such as Amazon S3, and block all other forms of traffic. Use custom lists of known bad domains to limit the types of domain names that your applications can access. Perform deep packet inspection on traffic entering or leaving your VPC. Use stateful protocol detection to filter protocols like HTTPS, regardless of the port used. To enable Network Firewall for your VPCs, you perform steps in both Amazon VPC and in Network Firewall. For information about using Amazon VPC, see Amazon VPC User Guide. To start using Network Firewall, do the following: (Optional) If you don't already have a VPC that you want to protect, create it in Amazon VPC. In Amazon VPC, in each Availability Zone where you want to have a firewall endpoint, create a subnet for the sole use of Network Firewall. In Network Firewall, create stateless and stateful rule groups, to define the components of the network traffic filtering behavior that you want your firewall to have. In Network Firewall, create a firewall policy that uses your rule groups and specifies additional default traffic filtering behavior. In Network Firewall, create a firewall and specify your new firewall policy and VPC subnets. Network Firewall creates a firewall endpoint in each subnet that you specify, with the behavior that's defined in the firewall policy. In Amazon VPC, use ingress routing enhancements to route traffic through the new firewall endpoints.",

You can use AWS OpsWorks CM to create and manage AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate and AWS OpsWorks for Puppet Enterprise servers, and add or remove nodes for the servers to manage. Glossary of terms Server : A configuration management server that can be highly-available. The configuration management server runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instance, and may use various other AWS services, such as Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Elastic Load Balancing. A server is a generic abstraction over the configuration manager that you want to use, much like Amazon RDS. In AWS OpsWorks CM, you do not start or stop servers. After you create servers, they continue to run until they are deleted. Engine : The engine is the specific configuration manager that you want to use. Valid values in this release include ChefAutomate and Puppet. Backup : This is an application-level backup of the data that the configuration manager stores. AWS OpsWorks CM creates an S3 bucket for backups when you launch the first server. A backup maintains a snapshot of a server's configuration-related attributes at the time the backup starts. Events : Events are always related to a server. Events are written during server creation, when health checks run, when backups are created, when system maintenance is performed, etc. When you delete a server, the server's events are also deleted. Account attributes : Every account has attributes that are assigned in the AWS OpsWorks CM database. These attributes store information about configuration limits (servers, backups, etc.) and your customer account. Endpoints AWS OpsWorks CM supports the following endpoints, all HTTPS. You must connect to one of the following endpoints. Your servers can only be accessed or managed within the endpoint in which they are created. opsworks-cm.us-east-1.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.us-east-2.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.us-west-1.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.us-west-2.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com opsworks-cm.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com For more information, see AWS OpsWorks endpoints and quotas in the AWS General Reference.

      "description": "This is the AWS Proton Service API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax and usage examples for each of the actions and data types for the AWS Proton service. The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response. Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI to access an API. For more information, see the AWS Command Line Interface User Guide. The AWS Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create service templates to provide standardized infrastructure and deployment tooling for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in turn, select from the available service templates to automate their application or service deployments. Because administrators define the infrastructure and tooling that AWS Proton deploys and manages, they need permissions to use all of the listed API operations. When developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, AWS Proton deploys their applications. To monitor their applications that are running on AWS Proton, developers need permissions to the service create, list, update and delete API operations and the service instance list and update API operations. To learn more about AWS Proton administration, see the AWS Proton Administrator Guide. To learn more about deploying serverless and containerized applications on AWS Proton, see the AWS Proton User Guide. Ensuring Idempotency When you make a mutating API request, the request typically returns a result before the asynchronous workflows of the operation are complete. Operations might also time out or encounter other server issues before they're complete, even if the request already returned a result. This might make it difficult to determine whether the request succeeded. Moreover, you might need to retry the request multiple times to ensure that the operation completes successfully. However, if the original request and the subsequent retries are successful, the operation occurs multiple times. This means that you might create more resources than you intended. Idempotency ensures that an API request action completes no more than one time. With an idempotent request, if the original request action completes successfully, any subsequent retries complete successfully without performing any further actions. However, the result might contain updated information, such as the current creation status. The following lists of APIs are grouped according to methods that ensure idempotency. Idempotent create APIs with a client token The API actions in this list support idempotency with the use of a client token. The corresponding AWS CLI commands also support idempotency using a client token. A client token is a unique, case-sensitive string of up to 64 ASCII characters. To make an idempotent API request using one of these actions, specify a client token in the request. We recommend that you don't reuse the same client token for other API requests. If you don’t provide a client token for these APIs, a default client token is automatically provided by SDKs. Given a request action that has succeeded: If you retry the request using the same client token and the same parameters, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response. If you retry the request using the same client token, but one or more of the parameters are different, the retry throws a ValidationException with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error. Client tokens expire eight hours after a request is made. If you retry the request with the expired token, a new resource is created. If the original resource is deleted and you retry the request, a new resource is created. Idempotent create APIs with a client token: CreateEnvironmentTemplateVersion CreateServiceTemplateVersion CreateEnvironmentAccountConnection Idempotent create APIs Given a request action that has succeeded: If you retry the request with an API from this group, and the original resource hasn't been modified, the retry succeeds without performing any further actions other than returning the original resource detail data in the response. If the original resource has been modified, the retry throws a ConflictException. If you retry with different input parameters, the retry throws a ValidationException with an IdempotentParameterMismatch error. Idempotent create APIs: CreateEnvironmentTemplate CreateServiceTemplate CreateEnvironment CreateService Idempotent delete APIs Given a request action that has succeeded: When you retry the request with an API from this group and the resource was deleted, its metadata is returned in the response. If you retry and the resource doesn't exist, the response is empty. In both cases, the retry succeeds. Idempotent delete APIs: DeleteEnvironmentTemplate DeleteEnvironmentTemplateVersion DeleteServiceTemplate DeleteServiceTemplateVersion DeleteEnvironmentAccountConnection Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs Given a request action that has succeeded: If you retry the request with an API from this group, if the original request delete operation status is DELETEINPROGRESS, the retry returns the resource detail data in the response without performing any further actions. If the original request delete operation is complete, a retry returns an empty response. Asynchronous idempotent delete APIs: DeleteEnvironment DeleteService",

It provides cost-efficient, resizeable capacity for an industry-standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks, freeing up developers to focus on what makes their applications and businesses unique. Amazon RDS gives you access to the capabilities of a MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle, or Amazon Aurora database server. These capabilities mean that the code, applications, and tools you already use today with your existing databases work with Amazon RDS without modification. Amazon RDS automatically backs up your database and maintains the database software that powers your DB instance. Amazon RDS is flexible: you can scale your DB instance's compute resources and storage capacity to meet your application's demand. As with all Amazon Web Services, there are no up-front investments, and you pay only for the resources you use. This interface reference for Amazon RDS contains documentation for a programming or command line interface you can use to manage Amazon RDS. Amazon RDS is asynchronous, which means that some interfaces might require techniques such as polling or callback functions to determine when a command has been applied.

By default, Resolver answers DNS queries for VPC domain names such as domain names for EC2 instances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers. Resolver performs recursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain names. You can also configure DNS resolution between your VPC and your network over a Direct Connect or VPN connection: Forward DNS queries from resolvers on your network to Route 53 Resolver DNS resolvers on your network can forward DNS queries to Resolver in a specified VPC. This allows your DNS resolvers to easily resolve domain names for Amazon Web Services resources such as EC2 instances or records in a Route 53 private hosted zone. For more information, see How DNS Resolvers on Your Network Forward DNS Queries to Route 53 Resolver in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Conditionally forward queries from a VPC to resolvers on your network You can configure Resolver to forward queries that it receives from EC2 instances in your VPCs to DNS resolvers on your network. To forward selected queries, you create Resolver rules that specify the domain names for the DNS queries that you want to forward (such as example.com), and the IP addresses of the DNS resolvers on your network that you want to forward the queries to. If a query matches multiple rules (example.com, acme.example.com), Resolver chooses the rule with the most specific match (acme.example.com) and forwards the query to the IP addresses that you specified in that rule. For more information, see How Route 53 Resolver Forwards DNS Queries from Your VPCs to Your Network in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide. Like Amazon VPC, Resolver is Regional. In each Region where you have VPCs, you can choose whether to forward queries from your VPCs to your network (outbound queries), from your network to your VPCs (inbound queries), or both.",

This guide provides descriptions of the Secrets Manager API. For more information about using this service, see the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide. API Version This version of the Secrets Manager API Reference documents the Secrets Manager API version 2017-10-17. As an alternative to using the API, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs, which consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms such as Java, Ruby, .NET, iOS, and Android. The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager. For example, the SDKs provide cryptographically signing requests, managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including downloading and installing them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services. We recommend you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to Secrets Manager. However, you also can use the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API to make direct calls to the Secrets Manager web service. To learn more about the Secrets Manager HTTP Query API, see Making Query Requests in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide. Secrets Manager API supports GET and POST requests for all actions, and doesn't require you to use GET for some actions and POST for others. However, GET requests are subject to the limitation size of a URL. Therefore, for operations that require larger sizes, use a POST request. Support and Feedback for Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager We welcome your feedback. Send your comments to awssecretsmanager-feedback@amazon.com, or post your feedback and questions in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Discussion Forum. For more information about the Amazon Web Services Discussion Forums, see Forums Help. How examples are presented The JSON that Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager expects as your request parameters and the service returns as a response to HTTP query requests contain single, long strings without line breaks or white space formatting. The JSON shown in the examples displays the code formatted with both line breaks and white space to improve readability. When example input parameters can also cause long strings extending beyond the screen, you can insert line breaks to enhance readability. You should always submit the input as a single JSON text string. Logging API Requests Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager supports Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, a service that records Amazon Web Services API calls for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By using information that's collected by Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, you can determine the requests successfully made to Secrets Manager, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. For more about Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager and support for Amazon Web Services CloudTrail, see Logging Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager Events with Amazon Web Services CloudTrail in the Amazon Web Services Secrets Manager User Guide. To learn more about CloudTrail, including enabling it and find your log files, see the Amazon Web Services CloudTrail User Guide.",

The service enables you to securely upload data to the Cloud for cost effective backup and rapid disaster recovery. Use the following links to get started using the Storage Gateway Service API Reference : Storage Gateway required request headers : Describes the required headers that you must send with every POST request to Storage Gateway. Signing requests : Storage Gateway requires that you authenticate every request you send; this topic describes how sign such a request. Error responses : Provides reference information about Storage Gateway errors. Operations in Storage Gateway : Contains detailed descriptions of all Storage Gateway operations, their request parameters, response elements, possible errors, and examples of requests and responses. Storage Gateway endpoints and quotas : Provides a list of each Region and the endpoints available for use with Storage Gateway. Storage Gateway resource IDs are in uppercase. When you use these resource IDs with the Amazon EC2 API, EC2 expects resource IDs in lowercase. You must change your resource ID to lowercase to use it with the EC2 API. For example, in Storage Gateway the ID for a volume might be vol-AA22BB012345DAF670. When you use this ID with the EC2 API, you must change it to vol-aa22bb012345daf670. Otherwise, the EC2 API might not behave as expected. IDs for Storage Gateway volumes and Amazon EBS snapshots created from gateway volumes are changing to a longer format. Starting in December 2016, all new volumes and snapshots will be created with a 17-character string.

      "description": "AWS Support The AWS Support API Reference is intended for programmers who need detailed information about the AWS Support operations and data types. You can use the API to manage your support cases programmatically. The AWS Support API uses HTTP methods that return results in JSON format. You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support API. If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a Business or Enterprise Support plan, the SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For information about changing your support plan, see AWS Support. The AWS Support service also exposes a set of AWS Trusted Advisor features. You can retrieve a list of checks and their descriptions, get check results, specify checks to refresh, and get the refresh status of checks. The following list describes the AWS Support case management operations: Service names, issue categories, and available severity levels - The DescribeServices and DescribeSeverityLevels operations return AWS service names, service codes, service categories, and problem severity levels. You use these values when you call the CreateCase operation. Case creation, case details, and case resolution - The CreateCase, DescribeCases, DescribeAttachment, and ResolveCase operations create AWS Support cases, retrieve information about cases, and resolve cases. Case communication - The DescribeCommunications, AddCommunicationToCase, and AddAttachmentsToSet operations retrieve and add communications and attachments to AWS Support cases. The following list describes the operations available from the AWS Support service for Trusted Advisor: DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks returns the list of checks that run against your AWS resources. Using the checkId for a specific check returned by DescribeTrustedAdvisorChecks, you can call DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckResult to obtain the results for the check that you specified. DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckSummaries returns summarized results for one or more Trusted Advisor checks. RefreshTrustedAdvisorCheck requests that Trusted Advisor rerun a specified check. DescribeTrustedAdvisorCheckRefreshStatuses reports the refresh status of one or more checks. For authentication of requests, AWS Support uses Signature Version 4 Signing Process. See About the AWS Support API in the AWS Support User Guide for information about how to use this service to create and manage your support cases, and how to call Trusted Advisor for results of checks on your resources.",

The names of the entities that you use to access this API, like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like \"V2\" or \"v2\", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to this version, because it has a number of significant improvements. If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic APIs have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces. For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version, see the WAF Developer Guide. WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AppSync GraphQL API. WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query strings, the Amazon API Gateway REST API, CloudFront distribution, the Application Load Balancer, or the AppSync GraphQL API responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is blocked. This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions, data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and an overview of how to use WAF, see the WAF Developer Guide. You can make calls using the endpoints listed in WAF endpoints and quotas. For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list. A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an AppSync GraphQL API. For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see Amazon Web Services SDKs. We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API and the prior versions, the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions, with the following major improvements: You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to distinguish the scope, you specify a Scope parameter and set it to CLOUDFRONT or REGIONAL. You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your rule group or web ACL calls. The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.",

Security: Support security applications are supported for users who have additional security needs, such as antivirus or data loss prevention. The API actions, along with AWS CloudTrail, allow these applications to detect when changes occur in Amazon WorkDocs. Then, the application can take the necessary actions and replace the target file. If the target file violates the policy, the application can also choose to email the user. eDiscovery/Analytics: General administrative applications are supported, such as eDiscovery and analytics.

Recovery control in Route 53 Application Recovery Controller includes extremely reliable routing controls that enable you to recover applications by rerouting traffic, for example, across Availability Zones or AWS Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a cluster. A cluster is a set of five redundant regional endpoints against which you can execute API calls to update or get the state of routing controls. You use routing controls to failover traffic to recover your application across Availability Zones or Regions. This API guide includes information about how to get and update routing control states in Route 53 Application Recovery Controller. For more information about Route 53 Application Recovery Controller, see the following: You can create clusters, routing controls, and control panels by using the control plane API for Recovery Control. For more information, see Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller Recovery Control API Reference. Route 53 Application Recovery Controller also provides continuous readiness checks to ensure that your applications are scaled to handle failover traffic.

Solar radiation is significant during unpredictable and short lived solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs); however, galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is omnipresent. The GCR intensity varies with latitude, longitude, and time due to effects of solar activity on the interplanetary magnetic field, as well as the Earth's magnetic field. Space radiation collides with gases in the atmosphere, leading to a complex shower of high energy radiation, the intensity and composition of which varies spatially and temporally. Excessive exposure to radiation can damage DNA and lead to long-term health effects such as an increased risk of cancer. Resulting radiation levels at commercial aircraft altitudes are greater than at sea level due. Aircrew are classified as radiation workers in some countries; however, planning to limit their exposure, and monitoring, is generally lacking. Both real-time measurements and predictive models of radiation in the atmosphere are important to mitigate the radiation risk crew.<br />We host a RESTful API to models of cosmic ray induced ionising radiation in the atmosphere.

      "description": "Apicurio Registry is a datastore for standard event schemas and API designs. Apicurio Registry enables developers to manage and share the structure of their data using a REST interface. For example, client applications can dynamically push or pull the latest updates to or from the registry without needing to redeploy. Apicurio Registry also enables developers to create rules that govern how registry content can evolve over time. For example, this includes rules for content validation and version compatibility.<br />The Apicurio Registry REST API enables client applications to manage the artifacts in the registry. This API provides create, read, update, and delete operations for schema and API artifacts, rules, versions, and metadata.<br />The supported artifact types include:<br />Apache Avro schema<br />AsyncAPI specification<br />Google protocol buffers<br />GraphQL schema<br />JSON Schema<br />Kafka Connect schema<br />OpenAPI specification<br />Web Services Description Language<br />XML Schema Definition<br />Important: The Apicurio Registry REST API is available from https://MY-REGISTRY-URL/apis/registry/v2 by default. Therefore you must prefix all API operation paths with ../apis/registry/v2 in this case. For example: ../apis/registry/v2/ids/globalIds/{globalId}.",

It's possible this connector is in beta or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.<br />API Design<br />API Styles and data formats<br />REST API<br />The API is organized around REST, providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.<br />Available HTTP methods<br />The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.<br />Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.<br />Schema<br />All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.<br />Meta<br />Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.<br />Idempotence (upcoming)<br />To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.<br />Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)<br />Request IDs<br />Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.<br />Fixed field types<br />Dates<br />The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).<br />This example 2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.<br />The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.<br />Prices and Currencies<br />All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).<br />For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.<br />All currency codes conform to ISO 4217.<br />Support<br />If you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.",

We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.<br />API Design<br />API Styles and data formats<br />REST API<br />The API is organized around REST, providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.<br />Available HTTP methods<br />The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.<br />Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.<br />Schema<br />All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.<br />Meta<br />Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.<br />Idempotence (upcoming)<br />To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.<br />Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)<br />Request IDs<br />Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.<br />Fixed field types<br />Dates<br />The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).<br />This example 2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.<br />The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.<br />Prices and Currencies<br />All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).<br />For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.<br />All currency codes conform to ISO 4217.<br />Support<br />If you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.",

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional cursor and limit parameters.<br />To fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a cursor parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in meta.cursors.next. If meta.cursors.next is null you're at the end of the list.<br />In the REST API you can also use the links from the response for added convenience. Simply call the URL in links.next to get the next page of results.<br />Query Parameters<br />| Name | Type | Required | Description |<br />| ------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |<br />| cursor | String | No | Cursor to start from.

By including the raw flag ?raw=true in your requests you can still receive the full request. Please note that this increases the response size and can introduce extra latency.<br />Errors<br />The API returns standard HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure of the API requests. For errors, we also return a customized error message inside the JSON response. You can see the returned HTTP status codes below.<br />| Code | Title | Description |<br />| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |<br />| 200 | OK | The request message has been successfully processed, and it has produced a response. The response message varies, depending on the request method and the requested data. |<br />| 201 | Created | The request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created. |<br />| 204 | No Content | The server has successfully fulfilled the request and that there is no additional content to send in the response payload body. |<br />| 400 | Bad Request | The receiving server cannot understand the request because of malformed syntax. Do not repeat the request without first modifying it; check the request for errors, fix them and then retry the request. |<br />| 401 | Unauthorized | The request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource. |<br />| 402 | Payment Required | Subscription data is incomplete or out of date. You'll need to provide payment details to continue. |<br />| 403 | Forbidden | You do not have the appropriate user rights to access the request. Do not repeat the request. |<br />| 404 | Not Found | The origin server did not find a current representation for the target resource or is not willing to disclose that one exists. |<br />| 409 | Conflict | The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the target resource. |<br />| 422 | Unprocessable Entity | The server understands the content type of the request entity, and the syntax of the request entity is correct but was unable to process the contained instructions. |<br />| 429 | Too Many Requests | You sent too many requests in a given amount of time (\"rate limit\"). Try again later |<br />| 5xx | Server Errors | Something went wrong with the Unify API. These errors are logged on our side. You can contact our team to resolve the issue. |<br />Handling errors<br />The Unify API and SDKs can produce errors for many reasons, such as a failed requests due to misconfigured integrations, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability.<br />Error Types<br />RequestValidationError<br />Request is not valid for the current endpoint. The response body will include details on the validation error. Check the spelling and types of your attributes, and ensure you are not passing data that is outside of the specification.<br />UnsupportedFiltersError<br />Filters in the request are valid, but not supported by the connector. Remove the unsupported filter(s) to get a successful response.<br />UnsupportedSortFieldError<br />Sort field (sort[by]) in the request is valid, but not supported by the connector. Replace or remove the sort field to get a successful response.<br />InvalidCursorError<br />Pagination cursor in the request is not valid for the current connector. Make sure to use a cursor returned from the API, for the same connector.<br />ConnectorExecutionError<br />A Unified API request made via one of our downstream connectors returned an unexpected error. The status_code returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.<br />UnauthorizedError<br />We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: Authorization: 'Bearer sklive*'<br />ConnectorCredentialsError<br />A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.<br />ConnectorDisabledError<br />A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.<br />ConnectorRateLimitError<br />You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector. You will need to try again later.<br />RequestLimitError<br />You have reached the number of requests included in your Free Tier Subscription. You will no be able to make further requests until this limit resets at the end of the month, or talk to us about upgrading your subscription to continue immediately.<br />EntityNotFoundError<br />You've made a request for a resource or route that does not exist. Verify your path parameters or any identifiers used to fetch this resource.<br />OAuthCredentialsNotFoundError<br />When adding a connector integration that implements OAuth, both a clientid and clientsecret must be provided before any authorizations can be performed.

Verify your serviceid is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided unifiedapi.<br />OAuthRedirectUriError<br />A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid redirect_uri. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.<br />OAuthInvalidStateError<br />The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.<br />OAuthCodeExchangeError<br />When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an access_token during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.<br />OAuthConnectorError<br />It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in beta or still under development.

Apideck uses cursor-based pagination via the optional cursor and limit parameters.<br />To fetch the first page of results, call the list API without a cursor parameter. Afterwards you can fetch subsequent pages by providing a cursor parameter. You will find the next cursor in the response body in meta.cursors.next. If meta.cursors.next is null you're at the end of the list.<br />In the REST API you can also use the links from the response for added convenience.

The status_code returned is proxied through to error response along with their original response via the error detail.<br />UnauthorizedError<br />We were unable to authorize the request as made. This can happen for a number of reasons, from missing header params to passing an incorrect authorization token. Verify your Api Key is being set correctly in the authorization header. ie: Authorization: 'Bearer sklive*'<br />ConnectorCredentialsError<br />A request using a given connector has not been authorized. Ensure the connector you are trying to use has been configured correctly and been authorized for use.<br />ConnectorDisabledError<br />A request has been made to a connector that has since been disabled. This may be temporary - You can contact our team to resolve the issue.<br />ConnectorRateLimitError<br />You sent too many request to a connector. These rate limits vary from connector to connector.

Verify your applicationid is correct, and that this connector has been added and configured for your application.<br />ConnectionNotFoundError<br />A valid connection could not be found associated to your applicationid. Something may_ have interrupted the authorization flow. You may need to start the connector authorization process again.<br />ConnectionSettingsError<br />The connector has required settings that were not supplied. Verify connection.settings contains all required settings for the connector to be callable.<br />ConnectorNotFoundError<br />A request was made for an unknown connector. Verify your serviceid is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided unifiedapi.<br />OAuthRedirectUriError<br />A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid redirect_uri. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.<br />OAuthInvalidStateError<br />The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.<br />OAuthCodeExchangeError<br />When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an access_token during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.<br />OAuthConnectorError<br />It seems something went wrong on the connector side. It's possible this connector is in beta or still under development.

It's possible this connector is in beta or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.<br />ConnectorWorkflowMappingError<br />The composite api calls required for this operation have not been mapped entirely. It's possible this connector is in beta or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.<br />ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError<br />You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.<br />PaginationNotSupportedError<br />Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in beta or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.<br />API Design<br />API Styles and data formats<br />REST API<br />The API is organized around REST, providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.<br />Available HTTP methods<br />The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.<br />Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.<br />Schema<br />All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.<br />Meta<br />Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.<br />Idempotence (upcoming)<br />To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.<br />Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)<br />Request IDs<br />Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.<br />Fixed field types<br />Dates<br />The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).<br />This example 2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.<br />The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.<br />Prices and Currencies<br />All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).<br />For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.<br />All currency codes conform to ISO 4217.<br />Support<br />If you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.",

Verify your serviceid is spelled correctly, and that this connector is enabled for your provided unifiedapi.<br />OAuthRedirectUriError<br />A request was made either in a connector authorization flow, or attempting to revoke connector access without a valid redirect_uri. This is the url the user should be returned to on completion of process.<br />OAuthInvalidStateError<br />The state param is required and is used to ensure the outgoing authorization state has not been altered before the user is redirected back. It also contains required params needed to identify the connector being used. If this has been altered, the authorization will not succeed.<br />OAuthCodeExchangeError<br />When attempting to exchange the authorization code for an access_token during an OAuth flow, an error occurred. This may be temporary. You can reattempt authorization or contact our team to resolve the issue.<br />OAuthConnectorError<br />It seems something went wrong on the connector side.

It's possible this connector is in beta or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.<br />ConnectorOperationUnsupportedError<br />You're attempting a call that is not supported by the connector. It's likely this operation is supported by another connector, but we're unable to implement for this one.<br />PaginationNotSupportedError<br />Pagination is not yet supported for this connector, try removing limit and/or cursor from the query. It's possible this connector is in beta or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.<br />API Design<br />API Styles and data formats<br />REST API<br />The API is organized around REST, providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.<br />Available HTTP methods<br />The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.<br />Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.<br />Schema<br />All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.<br />Meta<br />Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.<br />Idempotence (upcoming)<br />To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.<br />Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)<br />Request IDs<br />Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.<br />Fixed field types<br />Dates<br />The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).<br />This example 2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.<br />The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.<br />Prices and Currencies<br />All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).<br />For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.<br />All currency codes conform to ISO 4217.<br />Support<br />If you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.",

It's possible this connector is in beta or still under development. We've been notified and are working to fix this issue.<br />API Design<br />API Styles and data formats<br />REST API<br />The API is organized around REST, providing simple and predictable URIs to access and modify objects. Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.<br />Available HTTP methods<br />The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.<br />Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.<br />Schema<br />All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.<br />Meta<br />Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.<br />Idempotence (upcoming)<br />To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.<br />Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)<br />Request IDs<br />Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.<br />Fixed field types<br />Dates<br />The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).<br />This example 2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.<br />The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.<br />Prices and Currencies<br />All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).<br />For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.<br />All currency codes conform to ISO 4217.<br />Support<br />If you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.",

Requests support standard HTTP methods like GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE and standard status codes. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors. In all API requests, you must set the content-type HTTP header to application/json. All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over HTTP will fail.<br />Available HTTP methods<br />The Apideck API uses HTTP verbs to understand if you want to read (GET), delete (DELETE) or create (POST) an object. When your web application cannot do a POST or DELETE, we provide the ability to set the method through the query parameter \\_method.<br />Response bodies are always UTF-8 encoded JSON objects, unless explicitly documented otherwise. For some endpoints and use cases we divert from REST to provide a better developer experience.<br />Schema<br />All API requests and response bodies adhere to a common JSON format representing individual items, collections of items, links to related items and additional meta data.<br />Meta<br />Meta data can be represented as a top level member named “meta”. Any information may be provided in the meta data. It’s most common use is to return the total number of records when requesting a collection of resources.<br />Idempotence (upcoming)<br />To prevent the creation of duplicate resources, every POST method (such as one that creates a consumer record) must specify a unique value for the X-Unique-Transaction-ID header name. Uniquely identifying each unique POST request ensures that the API processes a given request once and only once.<br />Uniquely identifying new resource-creation POSTs is especially important when the outcome of a response is ambiguous because of a transient service interruption, such as a server-side timeout or network disruption. If a service interruption occurs, then the client application can safely retry the uniquely identified request without creating duplicate operations. (API endpoints that guarantee that every uniquely identified request is processed only once no matter how many times that uniquely identifiable request is made are described as idempotent.)<br />Request IDs<br />Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under Request-Id. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your Dashboard. If you need to contact us about a specific request, providing the request identifier will ensure the fastest possible resolution.<br />Fixed field types<br />Dates<br />The dates returned by the API are all represented in UTC (ISO8601 format).<br />This example 2019-11-14T00:55:31.820Z is defined by the ISO 8601 standard. The T in the middle separates the year-month-day portion from the hour-minute-second portion. The Z on the end means UTC, that is, an offset-from-UTC of zero hours-minutes-seconds. The Z is pronounced \"Zulu\" per military/aviation tradition.<br />The ISO 8601 standard is more modern. The formats are wisely designed to be easy to parse by machine as well as easy to read by humans across cultures.<br />Prices and Currencies<br />All prices returned by the API are represented as integer amounts in a currency’s smallest unit. For example, $5 USD would be returned as 500 (i.e, 500 cents).<br />For zero-decimal currencies, amounts will still be provided as an integer but without the need to divide by 100. For example, an amount of ¥5 (JPY) would be returned as 5.<br />All currency codes conform to ISO 4217.<br />Support<br />If you have problems or need help with your case, you can always reach out to our Support.",

Additional /song/search operation is available for searching songs given a query String.<br />Endpoint<br />The API endpoint for the SearchLy API v1 is as follows:<br />Motivation<br />This project was built in order to create an API for searching similarities based on song lyrics. There are a lot of songs in the industry and most of them are talking about the same topic. What I wanted to prove with SearchLy was to estimate how similar are two songs between them based on the meaning of their lyrics.<br />SearchLy is using a database of 100k songs from AZLyrics, using this scraper, which is being updated periodically. Then, using word2vec and NMSLIB, it was possible to create an index where you can search similarities using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm.<br />> Note: I am currently using a micro-instance from DigitalOcean where the API is deployed, so you should expect a bad performance. However, if this API becomes popular I will deploy it in a bigger instance.",

We encourage you to explicitly request this version via the Accept header.<br /> Accept: application/vnd.abr-ato.v1+json<br />Schema<br />All API access is over HTTPS, and accessed from https://api.abr.ato.gov.au. All data is sent and received as JSON. Blank fields are included.<br /> All dates use the ISO 8601 format:<br /> YYYY-MM-DD<br /> For example: 2017-07-01 (the 1st of July 2017)<br /> All timestamps use the ISO 8601 format:<br /> YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ<br /> For example: 2017-07-01T11:05:06+10:00<br />Timezones<br />Some requests allow for specifying timestamps or generate timestamps with time zone information. We apply the following rules, in order of priority, to determine timezone information for API calls.<br />Explicitly provide an ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone information<br />For API calls that allow for a timestamp to be specified, we use that exact timestamp.<br /> For example: 2017-07-01T11:05:06+10:00<br />Pagination<br />Information about pagination is provided in the Link header.<br /> For example:<br /> Link:; rel=\"next\",; rel=\"last\"<br />rel=\"next\" states that the next page is page=2. This makes sense, since by default, all paginated queries start at page 1. rel=\"last\" provides some more information, stating that the last page of results is on page 34. Accordingly, we have 33 more pages of information that we can consume.<br />Parameters<br />Many API methods take optional parameters:<br /> GET /individuals/1234/addresses/?addressType='Mailing'<br />In this example, the '1234' value is provided for the :partyId parameter in the path while :addressType is passed in the query string.<br />For POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE requests, parameters not included in the URL should be encoded as JSON with a Content-Type of 'application/json'.<br />Metadata<br />The API provides metadata services that you can use to discover information about the classifcation schemes and values used by the Registry.<br /> For example:<br /> GET /classifications/roles<br /> Sample response:<br /> [<br /> {<br /> \"id\": \"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440001\",<br /> \"role\": \"Director\",<br /> \"roleDescription\": \"An individual responsible for managing a company's ...\",<br /> \"relationship\": \"Directorship\",<br /> \"reciprocalRole\": \"Company\",<br /> \"reciprocalRoleDescription\": \"An incorporated legal entity.\"<br /> },<br /> {<br /> ...<br /> }<br /> ]<br />Root Endpoint<br />You can issue a GET request to the root endpoint (also known as the service root) to get all the endpoint categories that the REST API supports:<br /> curl https://api.abr.ato.gov.au<br />Authentication<br />The Business Registries API supports API Key authentication.<br /> When you sign up for an account, you are given your first API key. You can generate additional API keys, and delete<br /> API keys (as you may need to rotate your keys in the future). You authenticate to the Business Registries API by<br /> providing your secret key in the request header.<br /> Note: Some requests will return 404 Not Found, instead of 403 Permission Denied.

ChangePoint Detect is for detecting trend changes in time series. In stateful mode, user can store time series, the stored time series will be used for detection anomalies. Under this mode, user can still use the above three functionalities by only giving a time range without preparing time series in client side. Besides the above three functionalities, stateful model also provide group based detection and labeling service. By leveraging labeling service user can provide labels for each detection result, these labels will be used for retuning or regenerating detection models. Inconsistency detection is a kind of group based detection, this detection will find inconsistency ones in a set of time series. By using anomaly detector service, business customers can discover incidents and establish a logic flow for root cause analysis.",

      "description": "The SEDRA API is documented in OpenAPI format and uses ReDoc for documentation.<br />Introduction<br />This document describes the JSON API for the Syriac Electronic Data Research Archive (SEDRA). The SEDRA project is a linguistic and literary database of Syriac language and literature focusing on providing electronic access to the corpus of Syriac lexicons with linguistic information added to each entry in those lexicons. The API is a mechanism to provide the linguistic information stored in SEDRA to a broader audience.<br />Additionally there is a XML API for Syriac words which conforms to a prototype Semitic Languages schema which can be found in the XSD file https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/api/semiticLanguages.xsd.<br />Cross-Origin Resource Sharing<br />This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with the W3C spec and allows cross-domain communication from the browser.<br />All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.<br />Samples<br />Explaining how to lookup words in the SEDRA API is complex and would clutter the API description. For that reason we have chosen to give the explanation of how to lookup words in its own section. SEDRA can lookup words by the SEDRA word Id. However, it will often be the case that the consumer of information provided by the SEDRA API does not know the SEDRA word Id. It is for that reason that the SEDRA API provides a method to lookup words by the Syriac text. But that process is complicated by the nature of Syriac writing. So the SEDRA API will lookup words for consonantal, partially vocalized, and fully vocalized Syriac text. Using the word Id will provide the most accurate results as the exact word will be returned. Fully vocalized text will provide the next most accurate result. The least accurate results will be returned by partially vocalized and consonantal Syriac words in that order. Following are some samples to help understand how this works.<br />By Word Id 30862<br />By fully vocalized Syriac word ܐܰܒܳܪܳܐ<br />By partially vocalized Syriac word ܐܶܒܪܐ<br />By consonantal Syriac word ܐܒܪܐ.",

      "description": "#Documentation<br />This is the documentation for the partner endpoint of the BigOven Recipe and Grocery List API.<br />The update brings with it Swagger-based documentation. Swagger is an emerging standard for describing REST-based APIs, and with this Swagger-compliant endpoint (above), you can make ready-to-go interface libraries for your code via swagger-codegen. For instance, it's easy to generate libraries for Node.js, Java, Ruby, ASP.NET MVC, jQuery, php and more!<br />You can also try out the endpoint calls with your own apikey right here on this page. Be sure to enter your apikey above to use the \"Try it out!\" buttons on this page.<br />##Start Here<br />Developers new to the BigOven API should start with this version, not with the legacy API. We'll be making improvements to this API over time, and doing only bug fixes on the v1 API.<br />To pretend you're a BigOven user (for instance, to get your recently viewed recipes or your grocery list), you need to pass in Basic Authentication information in the header, just as with the v1 API. We do now require that you make all calls via https. You need to pass your apikey in with every call, though this can now be done on the header (send a request header \"X-BigOven-API-Key\" set to your apikey value, e.g., Request[\"X-BigOven-API-Key\"]=\"your-key-here\".)<br />##Migration Notes<br />For existing partners, we encourage you to migrate, and while at this writing we have no hard-and-fast termination date for the v1 API, we strongly prefer that you migrate by January 1, 2017. While the changes aren't overly complex, there are several breaking changes, including refactoring of recipe search and results and removal of support for XML. This is not a simply plug-and-play replacement to the v1 API. With respect to an exclusive focus on JSON, the world has spoken, and it prefers JSON for REST-based API's. We've taken numerous steps to refactor the API to make it more REST-compliant. Note that this v2 API will be the preferred API from this point onward, so we encourage developers to migrate to this new format. We have put together some migration notes that we encourage you to read carefully.<br />##Photos<br />See our photos documentation.<br />For more information on usage of this API, including features, pricing, rate limits, terms and conditions, please visit the BigOven API website.",

      "description": "Containers are virtual software objects that include all the elements that an app needs to run. A container has the benefits of resource isolation and allocation but is more portable and efficient than, for example, a virtual machine.<br /> This documentation describes the IBM Containers API, which is based on the Docker Remote API. The API provides endpoints that you can use to create and manage your single containers and container groups in Bluemix. Endpoints are summarized under the following tags:<br />Authentication: Retrieve and refresh your TLS certificates.<br />Private Docker images registry: Create your own private Docker images registry in Bluemix by setting a namespace for your organization.<br />Images: View, build, and push your images to your private Bluemix registry so you can use them with IBM Containers. You can also scan your container images with the Vulnerability Advisor against standard policies set by the organization manager and a database of known Ubuntu issues.<br />Single Containers: Create and manage single containers in Bluemix. Use a single container to implement short-lived processes or to run simple tests as you develop an app or service. To make your single container available from the internet, review the Public IP addresses endpoints.<br />Container Groups: Create and manage your container groups in Bluemix. A container group consists of multiple single containers that are all created from the same container image and as a consequence are configured in the same way. Container groups offer further options at no cost to make your app highly available. These options include in-built load balancing, auto-recovery of unhealthy container instances, and auto-scaling of container instances based on CPU and memory usage. Map a public route to your container group to make your app accessible from the internet.<br />Public IP addresses: Use these endpoints to request public IP addresses for your space. You can bind this IP address to your container to make your container accessible from the internet.<br />File shares: Create, list and delete file shares in a space. A file share is a NFS storage system that hosts Docker volumes.<br />Volumes: Create and manage container volumes in your space to persist the data of your containers.<br /> Each API request requires an HTTP header that includes the 'X-Auth-Token’ and 'X-Auth-Project-Id’ parameter.<br />X-Auth-Token: The JSON web token (JWT) that you receive when logging into the Bluemix platform. It allows you to use the IBM Containers REST API, access services, and resources. Run cf oauth-token to retrieve your access token information.<br />X-Auth-Project-Id: The unique ID of your organization space where you want to create or work with your containers. Run cf space --guid, where is the name of your space, to retrieve your space ID.<br /> For further information about how containers work in the IBM Containers service, review the documentation under https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/containers/container_index.html.",

Braze has created many different endpoints with specific requirements that will perform various actions and/or return various data. API access is done using HTTPS web requests to your company's REST API endpoint (this will correspond to your Dashboard URL as shown in the table below).<br />Customers using Braze's EU database should use https://rest.fra-01.braze.eu/. For more information on REST API endpoints for customers using Braze's EU database see our EU/US Implementation Differences documentation.<br />Braze Instances<br />Instance | Dashboard URL | REST Endpoint<br />----------- |---------------- | --------------------<br />US-01 | https://dashboard.braze.com or https://dashboard-01.braze.com | https://rest.iad-01.braze.com<br />US-02 | https://dashboard-02.braze.com | https://rest.iad-02.braze.com<br />US-03 | https://dashboard-03.braze.com | https://rest.iad-03.braze.com<br />US-04 | https://dashboard-04.braze.com | https://rest.iad-04.braze.com<br />US-06 | https://dashboard-06.braze.com | https://rest.iad-06.braze.com<br />EU-01 | https://dashboard.braze.eu or https://dashboard-01.braze.eu | https://rest.fra-01.braze.eu<br />Using Braze's Postman Collection<br />If you have a Postman account (MacOS, Windows, and Linux versions can be downloaded from their website located here), you can go to our Postman documentation and click the orange Run in Postman button in the top, right corner. This will allow you to create an environment, as well as edit the available POST and GET requests to suit your own needs.<br />Setting Up Your Postman Environment<br />The Braze Postman Collection uses a templating variable, {{instance_url}}, to substitute the REST API URL of your Braze instance into the pre-built requests. Rather than having to manually edit all requests in the Collection, you can set up this variable in your Postman environment. To do so, please follow the steps below:<br />Click on the gear icon in the top right corner of the Postman app.<br />Select \"Manage Environments\" to open a modal window which displays your active environments.<br />In the bottom right corner of the modal window, click \"Add\" to create a new environment.<br />Give this environment a name (e.g. \"Braze API Requests\") and add keys for instanceurl and apikey with values corresponding to your Braze instance and Braze REST API Key, as pictured below.<br />As of April, 2020 Braze has changed how we read App Group API keys. Instead of passing them in the request body or through url parameters, we now read the App Group Restapi_key through the HTTP Authorization header. API keys not passed through the HTTP Authorization Header will coninue to work until they have been sunset.<br />Using the Pre-Built Requests from the Collection<br />Once you have configured your environment. You can use any of the pre-built requests in the collection as a template for building new API requests. To start using one of the pre-built requests, simply click on it within the 'Collections' menu on the left side of Postman. This will open the request as a new tab in the main window of the Postman app.<br />In general, there are two types of requests that Braze's API endpoints accept - GET and POST. Depending on which HTTP method the endpoint uses, you'll need to edit the pre-built request differently.<br />Edit a POST Request<br />When editing a POST request, you'll need to open the request and navigate to the Body section in the request editor. For readability, select the raw radio button to format the JSON request body.<br />Edit a GET Request<br />When editing a GET request, you will need to edit the parameters passed in the request URL. To edit these easily, select the Params button next to the URL bar and edit the key-value pairs in the fields that will appear below the URL bar.<br />Send Your Request<br />Once your API request is ready to send, click on the 'Send' button next to the URL bar. The request will be sent and the response data will be populated in a section underneath the request editor. From here, you can view the raw data returned from Braze's API, see the HTTP response code, see how long the request took to process, and view header information.",

You can also get access to past messages and see your account profile.<br />The base URL to use for this service is https://api.bulksms.com/v1. The base URL cannot be used on its own; you must append a path that identifies an operation and you may have to specify some path parameters as well.<br />Click here to go to the main BulkSMS developer site.<br />In order to give you an idea on how the API can be used, some JSON snippets are provided below. Have a look at the messages section for more information.<br />Probably the most simple example<br />The insecure base URL http://api.bulksms.com/v1 is deprecated and may in future result in a 301 redirect response, or insecure requests may be rejected outright. Please use the secure (https) URI above.<br />HTTP Content Type<br />All API methods expect requests to supply a Content-Type header with the value application/json. All responses will have the Content-Type header set to application/json.<br />JSON Formatting<br />You are advised to format your JSON resources according to strict JSON format rules. While the API does attempt to parse strictly invalid JSON documents, doing so may lead to incorrect interpretation and unexpected results.<br />Good JSON libraries will produce valid JSON suitable for submission, but if you are manually generating the JSON text, be careful to follow the JSON format. This include correct escaping of control characters and double quoting of property names.<br />See the JSON specification for further information.<br />Date Formatting<br />Dates are formatted according to ISO-8601, such as 1970-01-01T10:00:00+01:00 for 1st January 1970, 10AM UTC+1.<br />See the Wikipedia ISO 8601 reference for further information.<br />Specifically, calendar dates are formatted with the 'extended' format YYYY-MM-DD. Basic format, week dates and ordinal dates are not supported. Times are also formatted in the 'extended' format hh:mm:ss. Hours, minutes and seconds are mandatory. Offset from UTC must be provided; this is to ensure that there is no misunderstanding regarding times provided to the API.<br />The format we look for is yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss[Z|[+-]hh:mm]<br />Examples of valid date/times are2011-12-31T12:00:00Z 2011-12-31T12:00:00+02:00<br />Entity Format Modifications<br />It is expected that over time some changes will be made to the request and response formats of various methods available in the API.<br />Where possible, these will be implemented in a backwards compatible way.<br />To make this possible you are required to ignore unknown properties.<br />This enables the addition of information in response documents while maintaining compatibility with older clients.<br />Optional Request Entity Properties<br />There are many instances where requests can be made without having to specify every single property allowable in the request format.<br />Any such optional properties are noted as such in the documentation and their default value is noted.",

      "description": "UPDATE: We have released a beta version of the new bunq API documentation.<br />NOTICE: We have updated the sandbox base url to https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/. Please update your applications accordingly. Check here: for more info.<br />PSD2 NOTICE: The second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) may affect your current or planned usage of our public API, as some of the API services are now subject to a permit. Please be aware that using our public API without the required PSD2 permit is at your own risk and take notice of our updated API Terms and Conditions on for more information.<br />Introduction<br />Welcome to bunq!<br />The bunq API is organised around REST. JSON will be returned in almost all responses from the API, including errors but excluding binary (image) files.<br />Please configure your implementation to send its API requests to https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/<br />There is a version of the Android app that connects to the bunq Sandbox environment. To create accounts for the Sandbox app, please follow the steps in the Android Emulator section.<br />Getting started<br />Before you start sending API requests, you need to get an API key and activate it. API activation happens when you install the API key and link your IP address and device to it (create an API context). The steps below will guide you through what you need to do to start sending custom API requests.<br />Here is an overview of what you can use to get started with the bunq API:<br />Create an API key. You can do it either in our developer portal or in the bunq app (Profile → Security & Settings → Developers → API keys). If you want to test our sandbox first, our bunq Developer is the best place to start.<br />Register a device. A device can be a phone (private), computer or a server (public). You can register a new device by using the POST /installation and POST /device-server calls. This will activate your API key. You only need to do this once.<br />Open a session. Sessions are temporary and expire after the auto-logout time set for the user account. It can be changed by the account owner in the bunq app.<br />Make your first call!<br />bunqAPIcontext<br />Versioning<br />Developments in the financial sector, changing regulatory regimes and new feature requests require us to be flexible. This means we can iterate quickly to improve the API and related tooling. Therefore, we have chosen not to attach any version numbers to the changes just yet.<br />We will inform you in a timely manner of any important changes we make before they are deployed on together.bunq.com. You can also subscribe to our API newsletter to make sure you don't miss any important updates.<br />OAuth<br />What is OAuth?<br />OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that will let your app connect to bunq users in a safe and easy way. Please be aware that if you will gain access to the account information of other bunq users or initiate a payment for them, you may require a PSD2 permit.<br />Get started with OAuth for bunq<br />To initiate authorization into the bunq user accounts, you need to create an OAuth Client and register at least 1 redirect URL for it.<br />You can have 1 OAuth Client at a time. Reuse your OAuth credentials for every authorization request.<br />The list of steps below will help you to get started:<br />Register an OAuth Client by creating an app in bunq Developer.<br />Add one or more Redirect URLs.<br />Get your client_id and secret from your app information tab in bunq Developer.<br />Redirect your users to the OAuth authorization request URL.<br />If the user accepts the authorization request, they will be redirected to the previously specified redirect_uri with an authorization code parameter.<br />Use the token endpoint to exchange the authorization code for an access_token.<br />Use the access_token as a normal API Key. Open a session or use our SDKs to get started.<br />You can set up an OAuth Client and add redirect URLs to it using the dedicated endpoints too. Follow the flow below to do it programmatically.<br />ℹ️ As a PSD2 user, you cannot log in to the bunq app. You need to follow the flow below to register an OAuth Client for your application.<br />bunqOAuthcredentials<br />What can my apps do with OAuth?<br />We decided to launch OAuth with a default permission that allows you to perform the following actions:<br />read and create Monetary Accounts;<br />read Payments & Transactions;<br />create Payments between Monetary Accounts of the same user;<br />create Draft-Payments (the user will need to approve the payment using the bunq app);<br />assign a Monetary account to a Card;<br />read, create and manage Cards;<br />read and create Request-Inquiries<br />read Request-Responses.<br />As a PSD2-licensed developer, you are limited to the permission scopes of your role.<br />Authorization request<br />Your web or mobile app should redirect users to the following URL:<br />https://oauth.bunq.com/auth<br />The following parameters should be passed:<br />response_type - bunq supports the authorization code grant, provide code as parameter (required)<br />client_id - your Client ID, get it from the bunq app (required)<br />redirect_uri - the URL you wish the user to be redirected after the authorization, make sure you register the Redirect URL in the bunq app (required)<br />state - a unique string to be passed back upon completion (optional)<br />Use https://oauth.sandbox.bunq.com/auth in the sandbox environment.<br />Authorization request example:<br />Android Emulator<br />In case you do not own an Android device on which you can run our Sandbox app for end-to-end testing, you can set up an emulator to run the bunq Sandbox app for Android.<br />Things you will need<br />The bunq Sandbox App APK that's optimised for emulating;<br />Android Studio.<br />Starting the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager<br />Open Android Studio.<br />From the top menu, select “Tools” > \"Android\" > \"AVD Manager\".<br />Setting up a new virtual device<br />Start the wizard by clicking on \"+ Create Virtual Device\".<br />Select a device (recommendation: \"Pixel 5.0\" or \"Nexus 6\") and press \"Next\".<br />Select an x86 system image (recommendation: Nougat, API Level 25, Android 7.1.1 with Google APIs) and press \"Next\". The image needs to have Google Play Services 10.0.1 or higher.<br />In the bottom left corner, select \"Show Advanced Settings\".<br />Scroll to \"Memory and Storage\".<br />Change \"Internal Storage\" to \"2048 MB\".<br />Change \"SD card\" to \"200 MB\".<br />Press \"Finish\".<br />Starting the virtual device<br />On the right side under \"Actions\", select the green \"Play\" button.<br />Wait for the device to boot, this may take a few minutes.<br />Installing the bunq Sandbox App APK<br />Open the command line.<br />Navigate to your Android SDK platform tools directory (e.g. cd ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools on macOS).<br />Make sure that the virtual device is started and has fully booted.<br />Run ./adb install ~/Downloads/bunq-android-sandboxEmulator-public-api.apk, this may take a few minutes, and should finish with \"Success\".<br />Creating an account or logging in<br />Create a sandbox account in the developer portal.<br />Log in to the sandbox app using the sandbox user credentials.<br />ℹ️ You will be asked to verify your phone number when you open the app for the first time. Sandbox does not send actual SMS messages. Enter any valid phone number and use the default verification code 992266.<br />If you couldn't generate a sandbox account in the developer portal, use Tinker:<br />Install Tinker.<br />Run tinker/user-overview to create a sandbox account. The output of the command will include the login credentials for the sandbox account.<br />⚠️ NOTE: It is not possible to create accounts using the regular signup in the app, bunq is not reviewing Sandbox applications.<br />Moving to Production<br />Have you tested your bunq integration to the fullest and are you now ready to introduce it to the world? Then the time has come to move it to a production environment!<br />To get started you'll need some fresh API keys for the production environment, which you can create via your bunq app. You can create these under \"Profile\" by tapping the \"Security\" menu. We do, however, highly recommend using a standard API Key instead of a Wildcard API Key. The former is significantly safer and it protects you from intrusions and possible attacks.<br />There's only a few things to do before your beautiful bunq creation can be moved to production. You're going to have to change your API Key and redo the sequence of calls to open a session.<br />The bunq Public API production environment is hosted at https://api.bunq.com.<br />Do you have any questions or remarks about the process, or do you simply want to show off with your awesome creations? Don't hesitate to drop us a line on together.bunq.com.<br />Please be aware that if you will gain access to account information of other bunq users or initiate a payment for them, you maybrequire a PSD2 permit.<br />Quickstart: Opening a Session<br />Goal<br />So, you want to start using the bunq API, awesome! To do this, you have to open a session in which you will be making those calls.<br />Getting an API key<br />To connect to the API, you have to make sure you have received an API key.<br />For production:<br />create an app in the developer portal, or<br />generate it in the bunq app (Profile → Security & Settings → Developers → API keys).<br />For sandbox<br />You can use one of the following ways:<br />create a sandbox user in the developer portal;<br />generate an API key in the sandbox app (Profile → Security & Settings → Developers → API keys);<br />get an API key from Tinker;<br />run a cURL request: curl https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/sandbox-user-person -X POST --header \"Content-Type: application/json\" --header \"Cache-Control: none\" --header \"User-Agent: curl-request\" --header \"X-Bunq-Client-Request-Id: $(date)randomId\" --header \"X-Bunq-Language: nlNL\" --header \"X-Bunq-Region: nlNL\" --header \"X-Bunq-Geolocation: 0 0 0 0 000\". Use sandbox-user-company to generate a business user.<br />Note that production API key is only usable on production and sandbox key is only usable on sandbox. Sandbox key has a sandbox_ prefix while production key does not have any noticeable prefixes.<br />Call sequence<br />The calls you need to perform to set up a session from scratch are the following:<br />1. POST installation<br />Each call needs to be signed with your own private key. An Installation is used to tell the server about the public key of your key pair. The server uses this key to verify your subsequent calls.<br />Start by generating a 2048-bit RSA key pair. You can find examples by looking at the source code of the sdk's located at github.<br />Headers<br />On the headers page you can find out about the mandatory headers. Take care that if you are in the sandbox environment, you set an Authorization header. Specific to the POST /installation call, you shouldn't use the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication or the X-Bunq-Client-Signature headers.<br />Body<br />Post your public key to the Installation endpoint (use \\n for newlines in your public key).<br />Response<br />Save the Installation token and the bunq API's public key from the response. This token is used in the Authentication header to register a DeviceServer and to start a SessionServer. The bunq API's public key should be used to verify future responses received from the bunq API.<br />2. POST device-server<br />Further calls made to the server need to come from a registered device. POST /device-server registers your current device and the IP address(es) it uses to connect to the bunq API.<br />Headers<br />Use the token you received from POST /installation in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header. Make sure you sign your call, passing the call signature in X-Bunq-Client-Signature header.<br />Body<br />For the secret, use the API key you received. If you want to create another API key, you can do so in the bunq sandbox app (or production app for the production environment). Login, go to Profile > Security and tap 'API keys'. The freshly created API key can be assigned to one or multiple IP addresses using POST device-server within 4 hours before becoming invalid. As soon as you start using your API key, it will remain valid until the next sandbox reset. For the secret, use the API key you received.<br />3. POST session-server<br />To make any calls besides installation and device-server, you need to open a session.<br />Headers<br />Use the token you received from POST /installation in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header. Make sure you sign your call, passing the call signature in X-Bunq-Client-Signature header.<br />Body<br />For the secret, use the API key you received.<br />Response<br />The token received in the response to POST /session-server should be used to authenticate your calls in this session. Pass this session's token in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header on every call you make in this session.<br />Quickstart: Payment Request<br />Goal<br />You want to offer bunq payments on a website or in an application.<br />Scenario<br />In this use case the consumer and the merchant both have a bunq account. The consumer wants to pay with bunq and enters their alias in the bunq payment field at checkout. The merchant sends the request for payment to the consumer when the consumer presses enter. The consumer agrees to the request in the bunq mobile app and the merchant has immediate confirmation of the payment. Please be aware that if you will gain access to account information of other bunq users or initiate a payment for them, you require a PSD2 permit.<br />Before you start<br />Make sure that you have opened a session and that for any call you make after that, you pass the session’s token in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header.<br />Call Sequence<br />The consumer is at checkout and selects the bunq payment method. This would be a logical time to open a session on the bunq server.<br />1. LIST monetary-account<br />When a request for payment is accepted, the money will be deposited on the bank account the request for payment is connected to. Let’s start by finding all your available bank accounts. Pick one of them to make the request for payment with and save its id.<br />2. POST monetary-account attachment (optional)<br />Optionally, you can attach an image to the request for payment.<br />Headers<br />Make sure you set the Content-Type header to match the MIME type of the image. It’s also required you pass a description of the image via the X-Bunq-Attachment-Description header.<br />Body<br />The payload of this request is the binary representation of the image file. Do not use any JSON formatting.<br />Response<br />Save the id of the posted attachment. You’ll need it to attach it to the request for payment.<br />3. POST request-inquiry<br />Next, create a request inquiry. A request inquiry is the request for payment that your customer can respond to by accepting or rejecting it.<br />Body<br />Pass the customer’s email address, phone number or IBAN in the counterpartyalias. Make sure you set the correct type for the alias, depending on what you pass. When providing an IBAN, a name of the counterpartyalias is required. You can provide the id of the created attachment.<br />Response<br />You will receive the id of the created request inquiry in the response. Save this id. You will need it to check if the customer has responded to the request yet.<br />4. GET request-inquiry<br />After you’ve sent the request for payment, its status can be checked.<br />Response<br />When the status is ACCEPTED, the customer has accepted and paid the request, and you will have received the money on the connected monetary account. If the status is REJECTED, the customer did not accept the request.<br />Quickstart: Create a Tab payment<br />Goal<br />You will create a tab that can be paid once by a single user, a so called TagUsageSingle, and explore three different ways to make the Tab visible to your customers:<br />QR code from the CashRegister<br />QR code from the Tab.<br />Before you start<br />Make sure that you have opened a session and that for any call you make after that, you pass the session’s token in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header.<br />Call sequence<br />1. POST attachment-public<br />Start by creating an attachment that will be used for the avatar for the cash register.<br />Header<br />Make sure you set the Content-Type header to match the MIME type of the image. It is also required you pass a description of the image via the X-Bunq-Attachment-Description header.<br />Body<br />The payload of this request is the binary representation of the image file. Do not use any JSON formatting.<br />Response<br />Save the uuid of the posted attachment. You'll need it to create the avatar in the next step.<br />2. POST avatar<br />Make an avatar using the public attachment you've just created.<br />Body<br />The payload of this request is the uuid of the attachment public.<br />Response<br />In response, you’ll receive the UUID of the avatar created using the attachment. Save this UUID. You’ll use it as the avatar for the cash register you're about to create.<br />3. LIST monetary-account<br />Get a listing of all available monetary accounts. Choose one, and save the id of the monetary account you want your cash register to be connected to. Each paid tab for the cash register will transfer the money to this account.<br />4a. POST cash-register<br />Create a cash register. Use the id of the monetary account you want to connect the cash register to in the URL of the request.<br />Body<br />In the body provide the uuid of the avatar you created for this cash register. Also make sure to provide a unique name for your cash register. Set the status to PENDING_APPROVAL.<br />Response<br />The response contains the id of the cash register you created. Save this id. You will need it to create subsequent tabs and tab items.<br />4b. Wait for approval<br />On the production environment, a bunq admin will review and approve your cash register. In the sandbox environment, your cash register will be automatically approved.<br />5. POST tab-usage-single<br />Create a new tab that is connected to your cash register. Use the id of the cash register you want to connect this tab to in the URL of your request.<br />Body<br />Give the tab a name in merchant_reference. Create the tab with status OPEN, and give the tab a starting amount. You can update this amount later.<br />Response<br />The response contains the uuid of the tab you created.<br />6. POST tab-item (optional)<br />You can add items to a tab. For instance, if a customer will be paying for multiple products via this tab, you can decide to add an item for each of these. Adding items to a tab is optional, and adding them will not change the total amount of the tab itself. However, if you've added any tab items the sum of the amounts of these items must be equal to the totalamount of the tab when you change its status to WAITINGFOR_PAYMENT.<br />7. PUT tab-usage-single<br />Update the status of the tab to WAITINGFORPAYMENT if you want the costumer to pay the tab, and you're done adding any tab items. You can use this request to make the tab visible for your costumers.<br />Visibility<br />To decide how you are going to make your tab visible, pass a visibility object in the payload.<br />Setting cashregisterqr_code to true will connect this tab to the QR code from the cash register. If this cash register does not have a QR code yet, one will be created. Only one Tab can be connected to the cash register’s QR code at any given time.<br />Setting tabqrcode to true will create a QR code specifically for this tab. This QR code can not be linked to anything else.<br />Quickstart: Create a TransferWise payment<br />Goal<br />You want to send a payment in currency other than euro outside the SEPA zone.<br />Before you start<br />Make sure that you have opened a session and that for any call you make after that, you pass the session’s token in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header.<br />ℹ️ bunq relies on TransferWise for international, so you need to create a TransferWise account linked to a bunq account to be able to create international transfers. You can do it either from the bunq app or using our API as described below.<br />Get the up-to-date exchange rate (optional)<br />You might want to check the latest currency exchange rate before making a transfer. Here’s how you can do it using the bunq API:<br />Check the list of supported currencies via GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-currency. Copy the needed currency code.<br />Create a temporary quote for the currency of your choice via POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote-temporary.<br />ℹ️ A quote is the exchange rate at the exact timestamp. Temporary quotes carry solely informative value and cannot be used for creating a transfer.<br />Read the temporary quote via GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote-temporary/{transferwise-quote-temporaryID}.<br />Create a TransferWise account<br />You need a TransferWise account linked to your bunq account to make TransferWise payments via the bunq API. Create one via POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-user, and save its ID.<br />ℹ️ You cannot use an existing TransferWise account.<br />Create a quote<br />Create a quote via POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote and save its ID.<br />ℹ️ Use amounttarget to indicate the sum the recipient must get. Amountsource, on the other hand, will indicate the sum you want to send, but it will not necessarily be the final sum the recipient gets.<br />ℹ️ Quotes are valid for 30 minutes so if you do not manage to create a transfer within this time, you will need to create another quote.<br />Get the exchange rate by reading the quote via GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/(transferwise-quoteID).<br />Create a recipient<br />If you have sent money via the TransferWise account linked to your bunq account, you can reuse the recipients. You can list their IDs via GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient.<br />To create a new, previously unused recipient, follow these steps:<br />Retrieve the fields required for creating the recipient as the requirements vary for the type of recipient in each country. Iterate sending the following request pair till there are no more required fields:<br />GET /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient-requirement<br />POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient-requirement<br />Create a recipient account using the final request body from the previous step with POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-recipient-requirement<br />Create a transfer<br />Finally, having both the quote ID and the recipient ID, you can create a transfer. 🎉<br />Check if there are any additional transfer requirements via POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-transfer-requirement.<br />Create a transfer via POST /user/{userID}/transferwise-quote/{transferwise-quoteID}/transferwise-transfer. You need to specify the ID of the monetary account from which you want the payment to be made.<br />Quickstart: Downloading attachments<br />Goal<br />Export receipts and invoices attached to payments to your application.<br />The scenario you want to achieve<br />The bunq user has accepted the authorization request and your application can read the bunq user’s account information.<br />Your application imports all the transactions and attachments.<br />The bunq user sees the transactions matched with the receipts and invoices in your application.<br />Before you start<br />Make sure that you have opened a session<br />Make sure you pass the session Token in the X-Bunq-Client-Authentication header in all the following requests of the session.<br />Call sequence<br />List the payments of the user via GET /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/payment.<br />Check if the payments have attachments via GET /user/{userID}/monetary-account/{monetary-accountID}/payment/{paymentID}/note-attachment. Save the attachment IDs.<br />Export the raw content of the attachments via GET /user/{userID}/attachment/{attachmentID}/content.<br />HINT: You can use callbacks to make sure you don’t miss anything happening on the bunq account.",

      "description": "You can use the CORE API to access the<br /> resources harvested and enriched by CORE. If you encounter any problems with the API, please report them to us.<br />Overview<br />The API is organised by resource type. The resources are articles,<br />journals and repositories and are represented using JSON data format. Furthermore,<br /> each resource has a list of methods. The API also provides two global methods for accessing all resources at once.<br />Response format<br />Response for each query contains two fields: status and data.<br /> In case of an error status, the data field is empty. The data field contains a single object<br /> in case the request is for a specific identifier (e.g. CORE ID, CORE repository ID, etc.), or<br /> contains a list of objects, for example for search queries. In case of batch requests, the response<br /> is an array of objects, each of which contains its own status and data fields.<br /> For search queries the response contains an additional field totalHits, which is the<br /> total number of items which match the search criteria.<br />Search query syntax<br />Complex search queries can be used in all of the API search methods.<br /> The query can be a simple string or it can be built using terms and operators described in Elasticsearch<br />documentation.<br /> The usable field names are title, description, fullText,<br />authors, publisher, repositories.id, repositories.name,<br />doi, oai, identifiers (which is a list of article identifiers including OAI, URL, etc.), language.name<br />and year. Some example queries:<br />title:psychology and language.name:English<br />repositories.id:86 AND year:2014<br />identifiers:\"oai:aura.abdn.ac.uk:2164/3837\" OR identifiers:\"oai:aura.abdn.ac.uk:2164/3843\"<br />doi:\"10.1186/1471-2458-6-309\"<br />Retrieving the latest Articles<br />You can retrieve the harvested items since specific dates using the following queries:<br />repositoryDocument.metadataUpdated:>2017-02-10<br />repositoryDocument.metadataUpdated:>2017-03-01 AND repositoryDocument.metadataUpdated:<br />Sort order<br />For search queries, the results are ordered by relevance score. For batch<br /> requests, the results are retrieved in the order of the requests.<br />Parameters<br />The API methods allow different parameters to be passed. Additionally, there is an API key parameter which is common to all API methods. For all API methods<br /> the API key can be provided either as a query parameter or in the request header. If the API key<br /> is not provided, the API will return HTTP 401 error. You can register for an API key here.<br />API methods",

Information is still pulled directly from National Rail in the background, providing the same level of real-time data without the additional complexity of having to interact with SOAP. (2): A JSON API interface for additional National Rail information: Giving developers the ability to pull a range of information about the Rail Network, via a JSON API interface. This is not an offering that National Rail currently provide, and is custom developed. Data is sourced from periodically updated XML documents, parsed, and provided for consumption via the departureboard.io API. This API is completely free to use for non-commercial purposes.

      "description": "Introduction<br />The DigitalOcean API allows you to manage Droplets and resources within the<br />DigitalOcean cloud in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests.<br />All of the functionality that you are familiar with in the DigitalOcean<br />control panel is also available through the API, allowing you to script the<br />complex actions that your situation requires.<br />The API documentation will start with a general overview about the design<br />and technology that has been implemented, followed by reference information<br />about specific endpoints.<br />Requests<br />Any tool that is fluent in HTTP can communicate with the API simply by<br />requesting the correct URI. Requests should be made using the HTTPS protocol<br />so that traffic is encrypted. The interface responds to different methods<br />depending on the action required.<br />|Method|Usage|<br />|--- |--- |<br />|GET|For simple retrieval of information about your account, Droplets, or environment, you should use the GET method. The information you request will be returned to you as a JSON object. The attributes defined by the JSON object can be used to form additional requests. Any request using the GET method is read-only and will not affect any of the objects you are querying.|<br />|DELETE|To destroy a resource and remove it from your account and environment, the DELETE method should be used. This will remove the specified object if it is found. If it is not found, the operation will return a response indicating that the object was not found. This idempotency means that you do not have to check for a resource's availability prior to issuing a delete command, the final state will be the same regardless of its existence.|<br />|PUT|To update the information about a resource in your account, the PUT method is available. Like the DELETE Method, the PUT method is idempotent. It sets the state of the target using the provided values, regardless of their current values. Requests using the PUT method do not need to check the current attributes of the object.|<br />|PATCH|Some resources support partial modification. In these cases, the PATCH method is available. Unlike PUT which generally requires a complete representation of a resource, a PATCH request is is a set of instructions on how to modify a resource updating only specific attributes.|<br />|POST|To create a new object, your request should specify the POST method. The POST request includes all of the attributes necessary to create a new object. When you wish to create a new object, send a POST request to the target endpoint.|<br />|HEAD|Finally, to retrieve metadata information, you should use the HEAD method to get the headers. This returns only the header of what would be returned with an associated GET request. Response headers contain some useful information about your API access and the results that are available for your request. For instance, the headers contain your current rate-limit value and the amount of time available until the limit resets. It also contains metrics about the total number of objects found, pagination information, and the total content length.|<br />HTTP Statuses<br />Along with the HTTP methods that the API responds to, it will also return<br />standard HTTP statuses, including error codes.<br />In the event of a problem, the status will contain the error code, while the<br />body of the response will usually contain additional information about the<br />problem that was encountered.<br />In general, if the status returned is in the 200 range, it indicates that<br />the request was fulfilled successfully and that no error was encountered.<br />Return codes in the 400 range typically indicate that there was an issue<br />with the request that was sent. Among other things, this could mean that you<br />did not authenticate correctly, that you are requesting an action that you<br />do not have authorization for, that the object you are requesting does not<br />exist, or that your request is malformed.<br />If you receive a status in the 500 range, this generally indicates a<br />server-side problem. This means that we are having an issue on our end and<br />cannot fulfill your request currently.<br />400 and 500 level error responses will include a JSON object in their body,<br />including the following attributes:<br />|Name|Type|Description|<br />|--- |--- |--- |<br />|id|string|A short identifier corresponding to the HTTP status code returned. For example, the ID for a response returning a 404 status code would be \"not_found.\"|<br />|message|string|A message providing additional information about the error, including details to help resolve it when possible.|<br />|request_id|string|Optionally, some endpoints may include a request ID that should be provided when reporting bugs or opening support tickets to help identify the issue.|<br />Example Error Response<br />Cross Origin Resource Sharing<br />In order to make requests to the API from other domains, the API implements<br />Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) support.<br />CORS support is generally used to create AJAX requests outside of the domain<br />that the request originated from. This is necessary to implement projects<br />like control panels utilizing the API. This tells the browser that it can<br />send requests to an outside domain.<br />The procedure that the browser initiates in order to perform these actions<br />(other than GET requests) begins by sending a \"preflight\" request. This sets<br />the Origin header and uses the OPTIONS method. The server will reply<br />back with the methods it allows and some of the limits it imposes. The<br />client then sends the actual request if it falls within the allowed<br />constraints.<br />This process is usually done in the background by the browser, but you can<br />use curl to emulate this process using the example provided. The headers<br />that will be set to show the constraints are:<br />Access-Control-Allow-Origin: This is the domain that is sent by the client or browser as the origin of the request. It is set through an Origin header.<br />Access-Control-Allow-Methods: This specifies the allowed options for requests from that domain. This will generally be all available methods.<br />Access-Control-Expose-Headers: This will contain the headers that will be available to requests from the origin domain.<br />Access-Control-Max-Age: This is the length of time that the access is considered valid. After this expires, a new preflight should be sent.<br />Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: This will be set to true. It basically allows you to send your OAuth token for authentication.<br />You should not need to be concerned with the details of these headers,<br />because the browser will typically do all of the work for you.",

      "description": "This document is intended as a detailed reference for the precise behavior of<br />the drchrono API. If this is your first time using the API, start with our tutorial. If you are upgrading from a previous version, take a look at the changelog section.<br />Authorization<br />Initial authorization<br />There are three main steps in the OAuth 2.0 authentication workflow:<br />Redirect the provider to the authorization page.<br />The provider authorizes your application and is redirected back to<br /> your web application.<br />Your application exchanges the authorization_code that came with<br /> the redirect for an accesstoken and refreshtoken.<br />Step 1: Redirect to drchrono<br />The first step is redirecting your user to drchrono, typically with a button<br />labeled \"Connect to drchrono\" or \"Login with drchrono\". This is just a link that<br />takes your user to the following URL:<br /> https://drchrono.com/o/authorize/?redirecturi=REDIRECTURIENCODED&responsetype=code&clientid=CLIENTIDENCODED&scope=SCOPESENCODED<br />REDIRECTURIENCODED is the URL-encoded version of the redirect URI (as registered for your application and used in later steps).<br />CLIENTIDENCODED is the URL-encoded version of your application's client ID.<br />SCOPES_ENCODED is a URL-encoded version of a space-separated list of scopes, which can be found in each endpoint or omitted to default to all scopes.<br />The scope parameter consists of an optional, space-separated list of scopes your application is requesting.<br />If omitted, all scopes will be requested.<br />Scopes are of the form BASESCOPE:[read|write] where BASESCOPE is any of user, calendar, patients, patients:summary, billing, clinical and labs.<br />You should request only the scopes you need.<br />For instance, an application which sends \"Happy Birthday!\" emails to a doctor's patients on their birthdays would use the scope parameter \"patients:summary:read\",<br />while one that allows patients to schedule appointments online would need at least<br />\"patients:summary:read patients:summary:write calendar:read calendar:write clinical:read clinical:write\".<br />Step 2: Provider authorization<br />After logging in (if necessary), the provider will be presented with a screen<br />with your application's name and the list of permissions you requested (via the<br />scope parameter).<br />When they click the \"Authorize\" button, they will be redirected to your redirect<br />URI with a code query parameter appended, which contains an authorization code to be<br />used in step 3. If they click the \"Cancel\" button, they will be redirected to<br />your redirect URI with error=access_denied instead.<br />Note: This authorization code expires extremely quickly, so you must perform<br />step 3 immediately, ideally before rendering the resulting page for the end<br />user.<br />Step 3: Token exchange<br />The code obtained from step 2 is usable exactly once to obtain an access token<br />and refresh token. Here is an example token exchange in Python:<br /> import datetime, pytz, requests<br /> if 'error' in get_params:<br /> raise ValueError('Error authorizing application: %s' % get_params[error])<br /> response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={<br /> 'code': get_params['code'],<br /> 'granttype': 'authorizationcode',<br /> 'redirecturi': 'http://mytestapp.com/redirecturi',<br /> 'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',<br /> 'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',<br /> })<br /> response.raiseforstatus()<br /> data = response.json()<br />Save these in your database associated with the user<br /> accesstoken = data['accesstoken']<br /> refreshtoken = data['refreshtoken']<br /> expirestimestamp = datetime.datetime.now(pytz.utc) + datetime.timedelta(seconds=data['expiresin'])<br />You now have all you need to make API requests authenticated as that provider.<br />When using this access token, you'll only be able to access the data that the<br />user has access to and that you have been granted permissions for.<br />Refreshing an access token<br />Access tokens only last 48 hours (given in seconds in the 'expires_in' key in<br />the token exchange step above), so they occasionally need to be refreshed. It<br />would be inconvenient to ask the user to re-authorize every time, so instead you<br />can use the refresh token like the original authorization to obtain a new access<br />token. Replace the code parameter with refresh_token, change the value<br />granttype from authorizationcode to refresh_token, and omit the<br />redirect_uri parameter.<br />Example in Python:<br /> ...<br /> response = requests.post('https://drchrono.com/o/token/', data={<br /> 'refreshtoken': getrefresh_token(),<br /> 'granttype': 'refreshtoken',<br /> 'client_id': 'abcdefg12345',<br /> 'client_secret': 'abcdefg12345',<br /> })<br /> ...<br />Webhooks<br />In order to use drchrono API webhooks, you first need to have an API application on file<br />(even if it is in Test Model).<br />Each API webhook is associated with one API application, go to<br />here to set up both API applications and webhooks!<br />Once you registered an API application, you will see webhook section in each saved API applications.<br />Create a webhook and register some events there and save all the changes, then you are good to go!<br />Webhooks setup<br />All fields under webhooks section are required.<br />Callback URL<br />Callback URl is used to receive all hooks when subscribed events are triggered. This should be an URL under your control.<br />Secret token<br />Secret token is used to verify webhooks, this is very important, please set something with high entropy. Also we will<br />talk more about this later.<br />Events<br />Events is used to register events you want to receiver notification when they happen. Currently we support following events.<br />Event name | Event description<br />---------- | -----------------<br />APPOINTMENT_CREATE | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is created<br />APPOINTMENT_MODIFY | We will deliver a hook any time an appointment is modified<br />PATIENT_CREATE | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is created<br />PATIENT_MODIFY | We will deliver a hook any time a patient is modified<br />PATIENTPROBLEMCREATE | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is created<br />PATIENTPROBLEMMODIFY | We will deliver a hook any time a patient problem is modified<br />PATIENTALLERGYCREATE | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is created<br />PATIENTALLERGYMODIFY | We will deliver a hook any time a patient allergy is modified<br />PATIENTMEDICATIONCREATE | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is created<br />PATIENTMEDICATIONMODIFY | We will deliver a hook any time a patient medication is modified<br />CLINICALNOTELOCK | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is locked<br />CLINICALNOTEUNLOCK | We will deliver a hook any time a clinical note is unlocked<br />TASK_CREATE | We will deliver a hook any time a task is created<br />TASK_MODIFY | We will deliver a hook any time a task is modified and any time creation, modification and deletion of task notes, associated task item<br />TASK_DELETE | We will deliver a hook any time a task is deleted<br />Webhooks verification<br />In order to make sure the callback URL in webhook is under your control, we added a verification<br />step before we send any hooks out to you.<br />Verification can be done by clicking \"Verify webhook\" button in webhooks setup page. After you click<br />the button, we will send a GET request to the callback URL, along with a parameter called msg.<br />Please use your webhook's secret token as hash key and SHA-256 as digest constructor, hash the msg value with<br />HMAC algorithm.<br />And we expect a 200 JSON response, in JSON response body, there should be a key called secret_token existing, and its value should be<br />equal to the hashed msg. Otherwise, verification will fail.<br />Here is an example webhook verification in Python:<br /> import hashlib, hmac<br /> def webhook_verify(request):<br /> secrettoken = hmac.new(WEBHOOKSECRET_TOKEN, request.GET['msg'], hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()<br /> return json_response({<br /> 'secrettoken': secrettoken<br /> })<br />Note: Verification will be needed when webhook is first created and anytime callback URl is changed.<br />Webhooks header and body<br />Header<br />Key | Value<br />--- | -----<br />X-drchrono-event | Event that triggered this hook, could be any one event above or PING<br />X-drchrono-signature | Secret token associated with this webhook<br />X-drchrono-delivery | ID of this delivery<br />Body<br />Key | Value<br />--- | -----<br />receiver | This will be an JSON representation of the webhook<br />object | This will be an JSON representation of the object related to the triggered event, this would share same serializer as drchrono API<br />Webhooks ping and deliveries<br />Webhooks ping and deliveries will be sent as POST requests.<br />PING:<br />You can always ping your webhook to check things, by clicking the \"Ping webhook\" button in webhook setup page. And a hook with header X-drchrono-event: PING would be sent to the callback URL.<br />Deliveries:<br />You can check recent deliveries by clicking the \"deliveries\" link in webhook setup page. And you can resend a hook by clicking \"redeliver\" button after select a specific delivery.<br />Webhooks delivery mechanism<br />We will delivery a hook the moment a subscribed event is triggered. We will not record any response header or body you send back after you receive the hook.<br />However we only consider the response status code. We will consider any 2xx responses as successfully delivered.<br />Any other responses, like 302 would be considered failing.<br />And we will try to redeliver unsuccessfully delivered hooks 3 times, first redeliver happens at 1 hour after the initial event,<br />second receliver happens 3 hours after the initial event, and the third redeliver happens 7 hours after the initial event.<br />After these redeliveries, if the delivery is still unsuccessful, you have to redeliver it by hand.<br />Webhooks security<br />You may want to secure your webhooks to only consider requests send out from drchrono. And this is where secret_token is needed in<br />request header.<br />Try to set the secret_token to something with high entropy, a good example could be taking the output of<br />ruby -rsecurerandom -e 'puts SecureRandom.hex(20)'.<br />After this, you might want to verify all request headers you received on your server with this token.<br />iframe integration<br />Some API apps provide additional functionality for interacting with patient data<br />not offered by drchrono, and can benefit by being incorporated into drchrono's<br />patient information page via iframe. We have created a simple API to make this<br />possible.<br />To make an existing API application accessible via an iframe on the patient<br />page, you need to update either \"Patient iframe\" or \"Clinical note iframe\" section in API management page,<br />to make the iframe to appear on (either the patient page or the clinical note page),<br />with the URL that the iframe will use for each page, and the height it should<br />have. The application will be reviewed before it is approved to ensure that it<br />is functional and secure.<br />Register a Doctor<br />iframe applications will appear as choices on the left-hand menu of the patient<br />page for doctors registered with your application. To register a doctor with<br />your application, make a POST request to the /api/iframe_integration<br />endpoint using the access token for the corresponding doctor. This endpoint does not<br />expect any payload.<br />To disable your iframe application for a doctor, make a DELETE request to the<br />same endpoint.<br />Populating the iframe<br />There are two places where the iframe can be displayed, either within the<br />patient detail page or the clinical note page, shown below respectively:<br />When requesting approval for your iframe app, you must specify a URL for one or<br />both of these pages which will serve as the base URL for your IFrame<br />contents. When a doctor views your iframe, the source URL will have various<br />query parameters appended to it, for example for the patient page the src<br />parameter of the IFrame will be:<br />The jwt parameter is crucial if your application transfers any sort of PHI and<br />does not implement its own login system. It encapsulates the other parameters<br />in a JSON web token (JWT) and signs them using SHA-256 HMAC<br />with your client_secret as the key. This verifies that the iframe is being<br />loaded within one of drchrono's pages by an authorized user. In production, you<br />should validate the JWT using an approved library (which are listed on the<br />official site), and only use the parameters extracted from the<br />JWT. Using Python and Django, this might look like:<br /> import jwt<br /> CLIENT_SECRET =<br />MAXTIMEDRIFT_SECONDS = 60<br /> def validate_parameters(request):<br /> token = request.GET['jwt']<br /> return jwt.decode(token, CLIENTSECRET, algorithms=['HS256'], leeway=MAXTIMEDRIFTSECONDS)<br />Modern browsers' same-origin policy means that data cannot be passed between<br />your application and drchrono's page through the iframe. Therefore, interaction<br />must happen through the API, using information provided in JWT.<br />Versions and deprecation<br />Stability Policy<br />Changes to this API version will be limited to adding endpoints, or adding fields to existing<br />endpoints, or adding optional query parameters. Any new fields which are not read-only will be optional.<br />Deprecation Policy<br />The drchrono API is versioned. Versions can be in the following states:<br />Active: This is our latest and greatest version of the API. It is actively supported by<br />our API team and is improved upon with new features, bug fixes and optimizations that do<br />not break backwards compatibility.<br />Deprecated: A deprecated API version is considered second best--having been<br />surpassed by our active API version.

Sellers can set up discounts (such as \"20% off\" and other types of offers) on specific items or on an entire customer order. To further attract buyers, eBay prominently displays promotion teasers throughout buyer flows. For complete details, see Promotions Manager.

      "description": "About CROssBAR & data<br />CROssBAR: Comprehensive Resource of Biomedical Relations with Deep Learning Applications and Knowledge Graph Representations<br />CROssBAR is a comprehensive system that integrates large-scale biomedical data from various resources e.g UniProt, ChEMBL, Drugbank, EFO, HPO, InterPro & PubChem and stores them in a new NoSQL database, enrich these data with deep learning based prediction of relations between numerous biomedical entities, rigorously analyse the enriched data to obtain biologically meaningful modules and display them to the user via easy to interpret, interactive and heterogeneous knowledge graphs.<br />CROssBAR platform exposes a set of 12 endpoints to query data stored in the CROssBAR database. These endpoints help the user to find data of interest using different parameters provided by the API endpoint.<br />For example,<br />https://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/crossbar/proteins?accession=A0A023GRW5 -> will provide protein information about accession 'A0A023GRW5' including its interactions, functions, cross-references, variations and more.<br />https://www.ebi.ac.uk/tools/crossbar/activities?moleculeChemblId=CHEMBL465983 -> will provide ChEMBL bio-interactions related information including targets and bio-activity measurements associated with molecule chembl id 'CHEMBL465983'<br />Knowledge graphs<br />Another use case of CROssBAR's API endpoints is in building knowledge graphs. These endpoints can be weaved together (output from one API endpoint fed as input to another API endpoint) programmatically to link nodes like protein, disease, drugs etc. as nodes of the graph. The endpoints are designed to be independent from each other which allows users the flexibility to drive biological networks from any facet e.g drug-centric, disease-centric, gene-centric etc. Our service for knowledge graph construction is available at https://crossbar.kansil.org.<br />An example for the part of the background queries on the CROssBAR API during the construction of a knowledge graph,<br />(with the aim of keeping the example simple, we have only included the processes related to pathways, genes/proteins and drugs/compounds)<br />In this example, we would like to find bio-active compounds (with a pChEMBL value threshold of at least 6.0) & drugs targeting all proteins belonging to \"WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking\" pathway (based on Reactome pathway annotations).<br />This can be achieved by using endpoints listed on this swagger documentation as illustrated in following steps-<br />Find bio-active compounds (with a pChEMBL value threshold of at least 6.0) & drugs targeting all proteins belonging to \"WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking\" pathway (based on Reactome annotations)<br />This can be achieved by using endpoints listed on this swagger documentation as illustrated in following steps-<br />Get all proteins from “/proteins” API endpoint which have a reactome pathway name equal to \"WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking\".<br />From the collection of uniprot protein accessions collected from step 1 above, we query “/targets” API endpoint to obtain the ‘targetchemblid’s of these proteins.<br />From the collection of targetchemblids collected from step 2 above, we query “/activities” API endpoint with pChEMBL value >=6, to obtain the ’moleculechemblid’s of the molecules that we need.<br />From the collection of uniprot protein accessions collected from step 1 above, we find out Drug names and ids from the “/drugs” API endpoint that targets our proteins.<br />From the collection of ’moleculechemblid’s obtained in step3, we query “/molecules” endpoint to get the compounds that are interacting with the genes/proteins belonging to the “WNT ligand biogenesis and trafficking” pathway.",

We provide an abstraction layer that reduces the complexity when extracting vehicle data and sending commands to vehicles from a variety of manufacturers.<br />The API has a RESTful architecture and utilizes OAuth2 authorization.<br />We are always available to handle any issues or just answer your questions. Feel free to reach out on post@enode.io<br />Registration for API access<br />In order to use the API you will need a clientid and clientsecret. Please contact us if you are interested in using our API in production, and we will provide these credentials.<br />Authorization<br />Vehicle / hardware access via the Enode API is granted to your application by the User in a standard OAuth Authorization Code flow.<br />> The authorization scheme documented here is the recommended approach for most situations. However, it is also possible to user other OAuth flows, non-confidential clients, and temporary users. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions about your use-case or the integration of your existing infrastructure.<br />Preparation: Configure your OAuth client<br />Because Enode API implements the OAuth 2.0 spec completely and without modifications, you can avoid rolling your own OAuth client implementation and instead use a well-supported and battle-tested implementation. This is strongly recommended. Information on available OAuth clients for many languages is available here<br />To configure your chosen OAuth client, you will need these details:<br />Your client_id<br />Your client_secret<br />Authorization URL: https://link.test.enode.io/oauth2/auth<br />Token URL: https://link.test.enode.io/oauth2/token<br />",

      "version": "1.0.0",
      "description": "Overview<br />FIRST /FMS FRC Events API is a service to return relevant information about the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Information is made available from events operating around the world.<br />For FRC, information is made available by the Field Management System (FMS) server operating at each event site. The FMS will attempt to sync all data from the event to \"the cloud\" as long as internet is available at the venue. If internet is unavailable, or \"goes down\" during the event, the FMS will automatically sync all data from the time the system was offline as soon as the connection is restored. The API will provide data as soon as it has synced, and we do not add any artificial delays. If you are receiving \"stale\" data, it may be because of connectivity problems at the venue. We recommend you try again later, and post on the FIRST FMS TeamForge site if the problem persists. (Note: FMS does not sync while a match is running, so data that has to do with a particular match should become available once the score has been revealed to the audience at the event.)<br />Migration and Program Notes:<br />Pay close attention to the addresses for calling the various endpoints- as well as the notes regarding endpoints with multiple possible responses (i.e. score details and rankings).<br />Documentation Notes<br />All times are listed in the local time to the event venue. HTTP-date values will show their timezone.<br />If you specify a parameter, but no value for that parameter, it will be ignored. For example, if you request URL?teamNumber= the teamNumber parameter would be ignored.<br />We will continue to support the current version of the API plus one version older. Old APIs are depricated once a version \"two times newer\" is available, at minimum 6 months. For example, version 2.0 and 1.0 are supported right now, but 1.0 will not be supported once 2.1 (or 3.0) is available. Versions may also be retired earlier with prior notice here in the documentation.<br />The full host address of the API is needed in all calls. The version number is required in each call in order to ensure your requests are made (and responses are returned) in the formats you anticipate. The version number for this documentation is found on the top of the page, in the title. If you call this version number, the API responses will match the formats listed below.<br />All of the APIs are capable of accepting the Accept HTTP header with either application/xml or application/json based on the desired return type. Any API call that results in an HTTP Status Code other than 200 (OK) will only be shown here as an application/json response to save space, but the content is the same regardless of the request type. All response will have a Content-Length and Date response header, but those are not shown in the documentaiton.<br />For all APIs that accept a query string in addition to the URI base, the order of parameters do not matter, but the name shown in the documentation must match exactly, as does the associated value format as described in details.<br />For response codes that are not HTTP 200 (OK), the documentation will show a body message that represents a possible response value. While the \"title\" of the HTTP Status Code will match those shown in the response codes documentation section exactly, the body of the response will be a more detailed explanation of why that status code is being returned and may not always be exactly as shown in the examples.<br />None of the APIs will show possible return here in the documentation of HTTP 401 (Unauthorized), but that code applies to all APIs as a possible response if the request is made without a valid token.<br />Last-Modified, FMS-OnlyModifiedSince, and If-Modified-Since Headers<br />The FRC Events API utilizes the Last-Modified and If-Modified-Since Headers to communicate with consumers regarding the age of the data they are requesting. With a couple of exceptions, all calls will return a Last-Modified Header set with the time at which the data at that endpoint was last modified. The Header will always be set in the HTTP-date format, as described in the HTTP Protocol. There are two exceptions: the Last-Modified Header is not set if the endpoint returns no results (such as a request for a schedule with no matches) and will also not be set if the request was an HTTP DELETE.<br />Consumers should keep track of the Last-Modified Header, and return it on subsequent calls to the same endpoint as the If-Modified-Since. The server will recognize this request, and will only return a result if the data has been modified since the last request. If no changes have been made, an HTTP 304 will be returned. If data has been modified, ALL data on that call will be returned (for \"only modified\" data, see below).<br />The FRC Events API also allows a custom header used to filter the return data to a specific subset. This is done by specifying a FMS-OnlyModifiedSince header with each call. As with the If-Modified-Since header, consumers should keep track of the Last-Modified Header, and return it on subsequent calls to the same endpoint as the FMS-OnlyModifiedSince Header. The server will recognize this request, and will only return a result if the data has been modified since the last request, and, if returned, the data will only be those portions modified since the included date. If no changes, have been made, an HTTP 304 will be returned. Using this method, the server and consumer save processing time by only receiving modified data that is in need of update on the consumer side.<br />If the Headers are improperly passed (such as the wrong Day of Week for the matching date, or a date in the future), the endpoint will simply ignore the Header and return all results. If both headers are specified, the request will be denied.<br />Response Codes<br />The FRC Events API HTTP Status Codes correspond with the common codes, but occasionally with different \"titles\". The \"title\" used by the API is shown next to each of the below possible response HTTP Status Codes. Throughout the documentation, Apiary may automatically show the common \"title\" in example returns (like \"Not Found\" for 404) but on the production server, the \"title\" will instead match those listed below.<br />HTTP 200 - \"OK\"<br />The request has succeeded. An entity corresponding to the requested resource is sent in the response. This will be returned as the HTTP Status Code for all request that succeed, even if the body is empty (such as an event that has no rankings, but with a valid season and event code were used)<br />HTTP 304 - \"Not Modified\"<br />When utilizing a Header that allows filtered data returns, such as If-Modified-Since, this response indicates that no data meets the request.<br />HTTP 400 - \"Invalid Season Requested\"/\"Malformed Parameter Format In Request\"/\"Missing Parameter In Request\"/\"Invalid API Version Requested\":<br />The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The client SHOULD NOT repeat the request without modifications. Specifically for this API, a 400 response indicates that the requested URI matches with a valid API, but one or more required parameter was malformed or invalid. Examples include an event code that is too short or team number that contains a letter.<br />HTTP 401 - \"Unauthorized\"<br />All requests against the API require authentication via a valid user token. Failing to provide one, or providing an invalid one, will warrant a 401 response. The client MAY repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field.<br />HTTP 404 - \"Invalid Event Requested\"<br />Even though the 404 code usually indicates any not found status, a 404 will only be issued in this API when an event cannot be found for the requested season and event code. If the request didn't match a valid API or there were malformed parameters, the response would not receive a 404 but rather a 400 or 501. If this HTTP code is received, the season was a valid season and the event code matched the acceptable style of an event code, but there were no records of an event matching the combination of that season and event code. For example, HTTP 404 would be issued when the event had a different code in the requested season (the codes can change year to year based on event location).<br />HTTP 500 - \"Internal Server Error\"<br />The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request. This is a code sent directly by the server, and has no special alternate definition specific to this API.<br />HTTP 501 - \"Request Did Not Match Any Current API Pattern\"<br />The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request. Specifically, the request pattern did not match any of the possible APIs, and thus processing was discontinued. This code is also issued when too many optional parameters were included in a single request and fulfilling it would make the result confusing or misleading. Each API will specify which parameters or combination of parameters can be used at the same time.<br />HTTP 503 - \"Service Unavailable\"<br />The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server. The implication is that this is a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. If known, the length of the delay MAY be indicated in a Retry-After header. This code will not always appear, sometimes the server may outright refuse the connection instead. This is a code sent directly by the server, and has no special alternate definition specific to this API.<br />See the notes at the top of this documentation for important information about HTTP Status Codes.<br />Authorization<br />In order to make calls against the FRC Events API, you must include an HTTP Header called Authorization with the value set as specified below. If a request is made without this header, processing stops and an HTTP 401 is issued. All Authorization headers follow the same format:<br />Authorization: Basic 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000<br />Where the Zeros are replaced by your Token. The Token can be formed by taking your username and your AuthorizationKey and adding a colon. For example, if your username is sampleuser and your AuthorizationKey is 7eaa6338-a097-4221-ac04-b6120fcc4d49 you would have this string:<br />sampleuser:7eaa6338-a097-4221-ac04-b6120fcc4d49<br />This string must then be encoded using Base64 Encoded to form the Token, which will be the same length as the example above, but include letters and numbers. For our example, we would have:<br />c2FtcGxldXNlcjo3ZWFhNjMzOC1hMDk3LTQyMjEtYWMwNC1iNjEyMGZjYzRkNDk=<br />NOTICE : Publicly distributing an application, code snippet, etc, that has your username and token in it, encoded or not, WILL result in your token being blocked from the API. Each user should apply for their own token.<br />If you wish to acquire a token for your development, you may do so by requesting a token through our automated system on this website.<br />AUTOMATED REMOVAL : If you do not activate your account within 72 hours of making your request for a token, or if you do not make at least one API request every twelve (12) months, your account/token will be marked as disabled for inactivity and subject to being deleted. (This policy does not apply to accounts with special operating agreements with FIRST)<br />HTTP401 and Authorization<br />Each Token can be individually enabled and disabled by FIRST. As such, a normally valid combination of username and AuthorizationToken could still be rejected. The possible return messages you may see in these instances are:<br />Incorrect Token (You supplied an AuthorizationToken, but it wasn't correct)<br />Account Disabled, Contact Support (You have been disabled for excessive traffic or abuse. Contact support)<br />Username Not Found (A username was found, but didn't match any on file)<br />Unable To Determine Authorization Token (The format of the Authorization header was incorrect)",

An example<br /> of such information would be the language of text or a particular text extractor for URL resources.<br />The supported types of analyses are:<br />lemmatization ⟶<br /> Finds out lemmata (basic forms) of all the words in the document.<br />correction ⟶<br /> Performs correction (diacritization) on all the words in the document.<br />topic detection ⟶<br /> Determines a topic of the document, e.g. finance or sports.<br />sentiment analysis ⟶<br /> Determines a sentiment of the document, i.e. how positive or negative the document is.<br />named entity recognition ⟶<br /> Finds named entities (like person, location, date etc.) mentioned the the document.<br />Encoding<br />The supplied text is expected to be in UTF-8 encoding, this is especially important for non-english texts.<br />Returned values<br />The API calls always return objects in serialized JSON format in UTF-8 encoding.<br />If any error occurs, the HTTP response code will be in the range 4xx (client-side error) or<br />5xx (server-side error). In this situation, the body of the response will contain information<br /> about the error in JSON format, with exception and message values.<br />URL limitations<br />All the requests are semantically GET. However, for longer texts, you may run into issues<br /> with URL length limit. Therefore, it's possible to always issue a POST request with all<br /> the parameters encoded as a JSON in the request body.<br />Example:<br />POST /s1/sentiment<br /> Content-Type: application/json<br /> {\"text\":\"There is no harm in being sometimes wrong - especially if one is promptly found out.\"}<br />This is equivalent to GET /s1/sentiment?text=There%20is%20no%20harm...<br />Request limitations<br />The API has other limitations concerning the size of the HTTP requests.

HTTP requests will be sent a 301 redirect to corresponding HTTPS resources.<br />Response to every request is sent in JSON format. In case the API request results in an error, it is represented by an \"error\": {} key in the JSON response.<br />The request method (verb) determines the nature of action you intend to perform. A request made using the GET method implies that you want to fetch something from Postman, and POST implies you want to save something new to Postman.<br />The API calls will respond with appropriate HTTP status codes for all requests. Within Postman Client, when a response is received, the status code is highlighted and is accompanied by a help text that indicates the possible meaning of the response code. A 200 OK indicates all went well, while 4XX or 5XX response codes indicate an error from the requesting client or our API servers respectively.<br />Individual resources in your Postman Account is accessible using its unique id (uid).

Everything that you have access to in Postman is accessible with an API Key that is generated by you.<br />For ease of use inside Postman, you could store your API key in an environment variable called postmanapikey and this Collection will automatically use it to make API calls.<br />API Key related error response<br />If an API Key is missing, malformed, or invalid, you will receive a 401 Unauthorised response code and the following JSON response:<br />Support<br />For help regarding accessing the Postman API, feel free to discuss it in our Discourse Community. You can also drop in a line at help@getpostman.com.<br />In the event you receive a 503 response from our servers, it implies that we have hit an unexpected spike in API access traffic and would usually be operational within the next 5 minutes.

You can also add your own data with the Web interface or the importer connectors provided. Gisgraphy is production ready, and has been designed to be scalable(load balanced), performant and used in other languages than just java : results can be output in XML, JSON, PHP, Python, Ruby, YAML, GeoRSS, and Atom.

The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP methods and HTTP status codes to specify requests and responses.<br />As an alternative to working directly with our API you may also consider to use:<br />Our CLI program hcloud<br />Our library for Go<br />Our library for Python<br />Also you can find a list of libraries, tools, and integrations on GitHub.<br />If you are developing integrations based on our API and your product is Open Source you may be eligible for a free one time €50 (excl. VAT) credit on your account. Please contact us via the the support page on your Cloud Console and let us know the following:<br />The type of integration you would like to develop<br />Link to the GitHub repo you will use for the Project<br />Link to some other Open Source work you have already done (if you have done so)<br />Getting Started<br />To get started using the API you first need an API token. Sign in into the Hetzner Cloud Console choose a Project, go to Access → Tokens, and create a new token. Make sure to copy the token because it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a Project, to interact with the API of another Project you have to create a new token inside the Project. Let’s say your new token is jEheVytlAoFl7F8MqUQ7jAo2hOXASztX.<br />You’re now ready to do your first request against the API. To get a list of all Servers in your Project, issue the example request on the right side using curl.<br />Make sure to replace the token in the example command with the token you have just created. Since your Project probably does not contain any Servers yet, the example response will look like the response on the right side. We will almost always provide a resource root like servers inside the example response. A response can also contain a meta object with information like Pagination.<br />Example Request<br />Changelog<br />You can find our changelog on our Developer Hub.",

Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.<br />The API is hosted on api.journy.io.<br />Official SDKs<br />Our SDKs are designed to help you interact with our APIs with less friction. They are written in several different languages and help bridge the gap between your application and journy.io APIs. They take away the need to know the exact URL and HTTP method to use for each API call among other things leaving you more time to focus on making your application.<br />| Language | Package | Source code |<br />|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|<br />| 💚 Node.js | npm install @journyio/sdk | github.com/journy-io/js-sdk |<br />| 🐘 PHP | composer require journy-io/sdk | github.com/journy-io/php-sdk |<br />| 🐍 Python | pip install journyio-sdk | github.com/journy-io/python-sdk |<br />| 💎 Ruby | Coming soon | Coming soon |<br />Your favourite programming language not included? Let us know!<br />In the meanwhile, you can use OpenAPI Generator to generate a client for your programming language.<br />Authentication<br />The journy.io API uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the connections screen.<br />Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.<br />All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.<br />For every request send to the API we expect a header X-Api-Key to be set with the API Key.<br />Permissions<br />When creating an API Key in the application you will have the choice to give permissions to an API Key (which you can change later on). These permissions restrict the API Key from different actions. When an API Key tries to perform a certain action it doesn't have the permissions for, you will receive a 401: Unauthorized response.<br />Rate limiting<br />To prevent abuse of the API there is a maximum throughput of 100 requests per minute. If you need a higher throughput, please contact us.<br />To keep our platform healthy and stable, we'll block API keys that consistently hit our rate limits. Therefore, please consider taking this throughput into account.<br />In every response the headers X-RateLimit-Limit and X-RateLimit-Remaining will be set. The X-RateLimit-Limit-header will always contain the current limit of requests per minute. The X-RateLimit-Remaining-header will always contain the amount of requests you have left in the current sliding window.<br />Errors<br />journy.io uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success. Codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g. a required parameter was omitted). Codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with journy.io's servers (these are rare).<br />When performing a POST- or PUT-request with a requestBody, or when including parameters, these parameters and fields will automatically be checked and validated against the API Spec. When any error occurs, you will get a response with an errors-field, structured as follows:<br />Support<br />Looking for a specific endpoint? Documentation not clear? We would love to help!",

      "description": "Introduction<br />The Linode API provides the ability to programmatically manage the full<br />range of Linode products and services.<br />This reference is designed to assist application developers and system<br />administrators. Each endpoint includes descriptions, request syntax, and<br />examples using standard HTTP requests. Response data is returned in JSON<br />format.<br />This document was generated from our OpenAPI Specification. See the<br />OpenAPI website for more information.<br />Download the Linode OpenAPI Specification.<br />Changelog<br />View our Changelog to see release<br />notes on all changes made to our API.<br />Access and Authentication<br />Some endpoints are publicly accessible without requiring authentication.<br />All endpoints affecting your Account, however, require either a Personal<br />Access Token or OAuth authentication (when using third-party<br />applications).<br />Personal Access Token<br />The easiest way to access the API is with a Personal Access Token (PAT)<br />generated from the<br />Linode Cloud Manager or<br />the Create Personal Access Token endpoint.<br />All scopes for the OAuth security model (defined below) apply to this<br />security model as well.<br />Authentication<br />| Security Scheme Type: | HTTP |<br />|-----------------------|------|<br />| HTTP Authorization Scheme | bearer |<br />OAuth<br />If you only need to access the Linode API for personal use,<br />we recommend that you create a personal access token.<br />If you're designing an application that can authenticate with an arbitrary Linode user, then<br />you should use the OAuth 2.0 workflows presented in this section.<br />For a more detailed example of an OAuth 2.0 implementation, see our guide on How to Create an OAuth App with the Linode Python API Library.<br />Before you implement OAuth in your application, you first need to create an OAuth client. You can do this with the Linode API or via the Cloud Manager:<br /> When creating the client, you'll supply a label and a redirect_uri (referred to as the Callback URL in the Cloud Manager).<br /> The response from this endpoint will give you a client_id and a secret.<br /> Clients can be public or private, and are private by default. You can choose to make the client public when it is created.<br /> A private client is used with applications which can securely store the client secret (that is, the secret returned to you when you first created the client). For example, an application running on a secured server that only the developer has access to would use a private OAuth client. This is also called a confidential client in some OAuth documentation.<br /> A public client is used with applications where the client secret is not guaranteed to be secure. For example, a native app running on a user's computer may not be able to keep the client secret safe, as a user could potentially inspect the source of the application. So, native apps or apps that run in a user's browser should use a public client.<br /> Public and private clients follow different workflows, as described below.<br />OAuth Workflow<br />The OAuth workflow is a series of exchanges between your third-party app and Linode. The workflow is used<br />to authenticate a user before an application can start making API calls on the user's behalf.<br />Notes:<br />With respect to the diagram in section 1.2 of RFC 6749, login.linode.com (referred to in this section as the login server)<br />is the Resource Owner and the Authorization Server; api.linode.com (referred to here as the api server) is the Resource Server.<br />The OAuth spec refers to the private and public workflows listed below as the authorization code flow and implicit flow.<br />| PRIVATE WORKFLOW | PUBLIC WORKFLOW |<br />|------------------|------------------|<br />| 1. The user visits the application's website and is directed to login with Linode. | 1. The user visits the application's website and is directed to login with Linode. |<br />| 2. Your application then redirects the user to Linode's login server with the client application's clientid and requested OAuth scope, which should appear in the URL of the login page. | 2. Your application then redirects the user to Linode's login server with the client application's clientid and requested OAuth scope, which should appear in the URL of the login page. |<br />| 3. The user logs into the login server with their username and password. | 3. The user logs into the login server with their username and password. |<br />| 4. The login server redirects the user to the specificed redirect URL with a temporary authorization code (exchange code) in the URL. | 4. The login server redirects the user back to your application with an OAuth accesstoken embedded in the redirect URL's hash. This is temporary and expires in two hours. No refreshtoken is issued. Therefore, once the access_token expires, a new one will need to be issued by having the user log in again. |<br />| 5. The application issues a POST request (see below) to the login server with the exchange code, clientid, and the client application's clientsecret. | |<br />| 6. The login server responds to the client application with a new OAuth accesstoken and refreshtoken. The access_token is set to expire in two hours. | |<br />| 7. The refreshtoken can be used by contacting the login server with the clientid, clientsecret, granttype, and refreshtoken to get a new OAuth accesstoken and refreshtoken. The new accesstoken is good for another two hours, and the new refresh_token, can be used to extend the session again by this same method. | |<br />OAuth Private Workflow - Additional Details<br />The following information expands on steps 5 through 7 of the private workflow:<br />Once the user has logged into Linode and you have received an exchange code,<br />you will need to trade that exchange code for an accesstoken and refreshtoken. You<br />do this by making an HTTP POST request to the following address:<br />Rate Limiting<br />With the Linode API, you can make up to 1,600 general API requests every two minutes per user as<br />determined by IP adddress or by OAuth token. Additionally, there are endpoint specfic limits defined below.<br />Note: There may be rate limiting applied at other levels outside of the API, for example, at the load balancer.<br />/stats endpoints have their own dedicated limits of 100 requests per minute per user.<br />These endpoints are:<br />View Linode Statistics<br />View Linode Statistics (year/month)<br />View NodeBalancer Statistics<br />List Managed Stats<br />Object Storage endpoints have a dedicated limit of 750 requests per second per user.<br />The Object Storage endpoints are:<br />Object Storage Endpoints<br />Opening Support Tickets has a dedicated limit of 2 requests per minute per user.<br />That endpoint is:<br />Open Support Ticket<br />Accepting Service Transfers has a dedicated limit of 2 requests per minute per user.<br />That endpoint is:<br />Service Transfer Accept<br />CLI (Command Line Interface)<br />The Linode CLI allows you to easily<br />work with the API using intuitive and simple syntax. It requires a<br />Personal Access Token<br />for authentication, and gives you access to all of the features and functionality<br />of the Linode API that are documented here with CLI examples.<br />Endpoints that do not have CLI examples are currently unavailable through the CLI, but<br />can be accessed via other methods such as Shell commands and other third-party applications.",

Please check out our introduction to Loket (API)<br />**The initial loading time of this developer portal may be very long due to the large number of endpoints designs being rendered when loading the page.<br />We are looking into an alternative solution but for now please bear in mind.**<br />General<br />The Loket.nl API is a RESTful API that exposes the data and features of the Loket.nl platform.<br />The API accepts and returns JSON and can only be accessed by registered users.<br />This documentation describes version 2 of the API.<br />Are you looking to partner up and start building an integration based on the Loket RESTful API? Please check out the steps for partners on our website .<br />Have you received your client and user credentials from us?

We would recommend to install the Postman desktop app.<br />Run in Postman<br />Do you want to contact us with any further questions or remarks regarding the Loket RESTful API? Please send an email to api@loket.nl, and we will get back to you.<br />Environments<br />The Loket.nl API has two different environments.<br />The first environment is the \"test\" environment which is used during development and returns test data.<br />The second environment is the production environment which is to be used exclusively by approved applications.<br />Both environments have their own URLs.<br />The test environment can be accessed at https://api.loket-test.nl/v2/<br />The production environment can be accessed at https://api.loket.nl/v2/<br />OpenAPI documentation<br />The endpoints are defined using the OpenAPI 3.0 specification,<br />an industry-wide recognized standard for describing REST API's.<br />Please note: the endpoint documentation in this portal is not designed to be fully compatible with any automatic code generation tools.<br />Change policy<br />Over the course of time the API, and policies regarding the API can and will change. These changes are subject to the following guidelines.<br />The following states hold true for the change policy for this API.<br />Loket.nl may sometimes introduce changes to the API and policies without advance notice.<br />Loket.nl will try to inform users of any (breaking) change in advance.<br />Loket.nl will not be liable to you or any third party for such modifications or any adverse effects resulting from such modifications.<br />Loket.nl will try to avoid breaking changes as much as possible.<br />Notification periods<br />In regard to changes Loket.nl will strive to adhere to the following notification periods per type of change.<br />Due to our versioning strategy at resource level this API has the possibility to run multiple versions of the same resource at one time.<br />This allows for a window in which both the old and new version are available.<br />Allowing for a gradual move to the new version.<br />| Type of change | Notification period | Support period old version |<br />|------------------|---------------|---------------|<br />| Non breaking change | 2 weeks | no new version |<br />| Breaking change | 2 weeks | 6 months |<br />| Critical | Due to the nature of these changes we might not be able to follow the normal procedure for change managment | depends on the severity of the issue |<br />We define a non breaking change as follows. Any change to the API that does not cause failures in the applications that consume that API.<br /> Introducing a new optional field to an existing resource<br /> Introducing a new endpoint<br /> Introducing a new operation (GET/PUT/POST/PATCH/DELETE)<br /> Introducing a new optional parameter to an endpoint<br /> Introducing a new version for a resource<br />We define a breaking change as follows. any change to an API that could potentially cause failures in the applications that consume that API.<br /> Changing an existing JSON element (name, datatype, pattern, min/max length etc)<br /> Removing a JSON element, endpoint, operation or parameter<br /> Introducing a required JSON element<br /> Introducing a required parameter to an endpoint<br /> Passing the obsoleteDate of a version for a resource<br />Versioning<br />The Loket API uses two types of versioning. API versioning and resource versioning.<br />API versioning<br />API versioning is done via the path where after the domain URL (api.loket.nl) the path starts with the API version. The current version of the API is V2.<br />The API version is expected to change rarely as resource versioning is available to tackle most issues that need versioning.<br />Resource versioning<br />Every JSON resource in the API is versioned via the Accept header.<br />Allowing users of the API to influence what version is returned by setting the mandatory accept header.<br />The Accept header of request should have a value like application/json;version=2018-01-01.<br />Here, the second part of the header is used to refer to a specific version of the resource (2018-01-01).<br />When calling the API it is possible to supply other dates rather than the exact resources version(s).<br />The businesslogic will select the version that is ON or BEFORE the given date.<br />For example: let's say there are two versions of a resource.<br />These are 2018-01-01 and 2018-09-01. When calling the API you supply application/json;version=2018-08-01,<br />in that case the API will use the version 2018-01-01 as its the nearest version in the past.<br />A response returns what resourceVersion was used and the 'obsoleteDate' of that version (in most cases this is NULL).<br />The obsoleteDate indicates when the resources version will no longer be available via the API.<br />With the introduction of a new version of a resource the obsoleteDate for the old version will be set to 6 months after the introduction of the new resource.<br />Allowing consumers of the resource 6 months to incorporate the change. Failure to do so will likely lead to failure in the implementation.<br />In this developer portal you can find the service contracts for each, active, version of a resource.<br />If, only if, there are multiple versions of a resource you can select the corresponding schema at that resource.<br />Changelog<br />The changelog for this API can be found here.<br />We strongly advise every user ofthe Loket REST API the subscribe to the email feed. Please check out the link on the changelog page.<br />Legal notices<br />Your use and access to the API is expressly conditioned on your compliance with the policies and restrictions related to the API.<br />If Loket.nl believes that you have or attempted to violate any term, condition, or the spirit of these policies or agreements, your right to access and use the API may be temporarily or permanently revoked.<br />Authentication<br />Authorization in the Loket API is based on the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 protocol. For general information on OAuth 2.0 we kindly refer to the publicly-available documentation, https://oauth.net/2/<br />An authorized user is required to call the Loket API.<br />Note: This is an SSL-only API.<br />Note: Only TLS 1.2 is supported.<br />| Environment | TokenUrl |<br />| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |<br />| Test | https://oauth.loket-test.nl/token |<br />| Production | https://oauth.loket.nl/token |<br />The following OAuth 2.0 flows are supported<br />Authorization Code flow (standard)<br />Refresh Token flow (extension on the Authorization Code Flow)<br />SSO flow (single sign-on)<br />Password flow<br />Authorization code flow<br />For most clients only the authorizationcode (and thus refreshtoken) will be supported.<br />Password grant type is not available for an external client.<br />Please click the link below to see documentation on implementing the authorization code flow by external clients.<br />Documentation on implementing the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow<br />Refresh token flow<br />After the authorization code flow yields a refresh token the refresh_token grant can be used to obtain an access/bearer token.<br />The expire time of the access/bearer is also returned in the response please take this into account.<br />With the refresh token flow the two factor step will be skipped.<br />Refresh token request example:<br />Paging<br />totalSize has an integer value indicating the total number of entities irrespective of the page size.<br />pageSize has an integer value indicating the maximum number of entities returned per page. The page size can be influenced by setting the pageSize query parameter.

See the section Query Parameters for more information.<br />Version<br />The version object provides information regarding the resource version of the entity requested.<br /> obsoleteDate contains the date of discontinuation for the requested resource version. The value of this field can be null indicating that the requested resource version is not planned to be obsoleted at the time of the request.<br /> resourceVersion shows the version of the requested entity. The resource version can be influenced by setting the Accept header.<br />Messages<br />The messages field contains a list of message objects related to the request made. Any warnings and errors will be communicated in this list of messages<br /> type has a string value indicating the type of message. At this time the Loket.nl API supports five types of messages: BrokenBusinessRule, Warning, Exception, ConcurrencyViolation and NotFound .<br /> description has a string value that describes the message that has occurred.<br /> code is an identifying code for the message. Please note that this code may change in the future. See the documentation portal for possible message codes for an endpoint.<br /> id relates the message to a specific entity in the reponse list. For example, in cases where a warning occurs for one of the entities in a list, the value of this field can be used to identify to which entity the warning applies. Currently implemented for endpoints where a multi-patch is performed (multiple actions are performed within one call) for example updating the status of one or more leaveRequests.<br /> properties an array that can contain additional information regarding the message. Currently not yet fully implemented.<br />embedded contains the list of entities as defined for each endpoint in the OpenAPI documentation. Please refer to that documentation for the contents of the embedded field for each endpoint. For endpoints that return only one entity (detail endpoints) the _embedded field is replaced with a content field. The content of this field can also be found in the documentation for each endpoint.<br />Headers<br />etag header is returned with every GET of a detail (single resource). This header is used for concurrency controle<br />Expires header is returned with every response to indicate how long a response can be cached<br />Content-Disposition header is used in case of downloads to provide a file name<br />HTTP status codes<br />The Loket.nl API supports the following http status codes.<br />| Code | Is returned when |<br />|------------------|---------------|<br />| 200 | The request to GET, PUT, PATCH or DELETE and object was recived and processed succesfully. The response might still contain messages of the type warning. |<br />| 201 | The request to insert (POST) a new object was recived and processed succesfully. The response might still contain messages of the type warning.|<br />| 400 | The request was received but could not be processed. The reason(s) will be given in the response. The content type of the response may be text/plain for API-level error messages, such as when trying to call the API without SSL otherwise the content will be application/json. |<br />| 401 | The bearer token provided in the authorization header is invalid. Do not retry the request until a new (valid) bearer token is acquired. |<br />| 403 | The user is not authorized to access the resource. The reason will be given in the response. Do not retry the request until the, configuration, issue is resolved. |<br />| 404 | The resource requested was not found/does not exist. |<br />| 409 | The give if-match header in a PUT request no longer represents the current state of the object. Please acquire the current state off the object, via a GET, and resolve the differences then try again. |<br />| 50* | A unforseen error occurred. Please check the request if everything seems te be in order on your side contact the support team. Provide as much information as possible to resolve the issue. |<br />Note: for a limited number of endpoint a so-called multi-patch may be performed (multiple actions within one call). In that case the status code will be 200 if at least on of the actions succeeds, if other any action(s) in that call fail(s) a message will be returned including the given id of that entity.<br />Caching<br />The API uses the Expires header to indicate how long the item can be reused from the local cache.<br />In most cases caching is not allowed for resources.<br />Exceptions excist, such as pictures like the employer logo and the employee photo, in these cases the cache duration is mentioned in the description of the resource.",

      "description": "Introduction<br />The Lumminary API was built to allow third parties to interact with Lumminary customers and gain access to their genetic data. The Lumminary API is fast, scalable and highly secure. All requests to the Lumminary API take place over SSL, which means all communication of Customer data is encrypted.<br />Before we dive in, some definitions. This is what we mean by:<br />|Term|Definition|<br />|-----------|-----------|<br />|Third party|A third party (also referred to as \"partner\" or as \"you\") is a company which offers services and products using genetic data.|<br />|Lumminary clients|The Lumminary client (also referred to as \"customer\") is an individual who has created an account on the Lumminary platform.|<br />|Lumminary|This is us - our services including the Lumminary platform, the API, the DNA App Store, the DNA Vault, the \"Connect with Lumminary\" button, and the website in its totality. |<br />|CWL|This is the acronym for the \"Connect with Lumminary\" button.|<br />|dataset|This is the term we use when we refer to a customer's genetic data.|<br />|Lumminary API|This is a library/module that you can use to integrate your apps with the Lumminary platform.|<br />|Lumminary toolkit|This is a stand alone application which helps you integrate with Lumminary without writing any code or interacting with the Lumminary API.|<br />Let's dive in, now.<br />Overview<br />Install Lumminary API Client and Toolkit<br />Obtaining credentials<br />Query customers authorizations<br />Query customer genetic data<br />Submit reports<br />\"Connect with Lumminary\" button<br />API specs<br />Overview<br />In order to use Lumminary services, you'll need to install the Lumminary API Client or Toolkit. The Lumminary API Client and Toolkit are available in multiple programming languages, and we also provide a sandbox environment which you can use for integration and tests.<br />There are a couple of differences between the API Client and the Toolkit. Mainly, it's about the ease of use for integration. The Toolkit is basically a stand-alone application that facilitates the integration with the Lumminary API without the need to modify your already existing code.<br />You use the Lumminary API Client when you want to integrate it inside your own application. This means it gives you full flexibility regarding the integration into your own workflow.<br />You use the Lumminary Toolkit for an integration where the Toolkit is placed alongside your own application. You can use the Toolkit from the CLI - for example, to run a cronjob that processes incoming orders. The Toolkit uses the Lumminary API Client.<br />Install Lumminary API Client and/or Toolkit<br />We provide the Lumminary API Client and Toolkit in multiple programming languages - default are PHP (minimum version 7.0), Python2.7 and Python3. However, if you need them in another language (Java, Obj-C, JavaScript, C#, Perl, CURL), please contact us.<br />How to install the Lumminary API Client<br />PHP example:<br />The PHP Lumminary API Client is available at: https://github.com/Lumminary/lumminary-api-client-php<br />If you are already using Composer, you can import the project by adding the following to your composer.json<br />| Error Id | Error Message |<br />|:-----------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|<br />| 1 | Invalid Security Token |<br />| 2 | Invalid Access Scopes |<br />| 3 | Customer refuses your request (this happens when the customer cancels instead of granting access) |",

It just works.<br />Include millions of licensed lyrics on your website or in your application legally.<br />The fastest, most powerful and legal way to display lyrics on your website or in your application.<br />Read musixmatch API Terms & Conditions and the Privacy Policy:<br />Before getting started, you must take a look at the API Terms & Conditions and the Privacy Policy. We’ve worked hard to make this service completely legal so that we are all protected from any foreseeable liability. Take the time to read this stuff.<br />Register for an API key:<br />All you need to do is register in order to get your API key, a mandatory parameter for most of our API calls. It’s your personal identifier and should be kept secret:<br />Integrate the musixmatch service with your web site or application<br />In the most common scenario you only need to implement two API calls:<br />The first call is to match your catalog to ours using the track.search function and the second is to get the lyrics using the track.lyrics.get api. That’s it!<br />API Methods<br />What does the musiXmatch API do?<br />The musiXmatch API allows you to read objects from our huge 100% licensed lyrics database.<br />To make your life easier we are providing you with one or more examples to show you how it could work in the wild. You’ll find both the API request and API response in all the available output formats for each API call. Follow the links below for the details.<br />The current API version is 1.1, the root URL is located at https://api.musixmatch.com/ws/1.1/<br />Supported input parameters can be found on the page Input Parameters. Use UTF-8 to encode arguments when calling API methods.<br />Every response includes a status_code. A list of all status codes can be consulted at Status Codes.<br />Music meta data<br />The musiXmatch api is built around lyrics, but there are many other data we provide through the api that can be used to improve every existent music service.<br />Track<br />Inside the track object you can get the following extra information:<br />TRACK RATING<br />The track rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is a song in musixmatch.<br />You can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular songs of an artist, of a music genre, of a lyrics language.<br />INSTRUMENTAL AND EXPLICIT FLAGS<br />The instrumental flag identifies songs with music only, no lyrics.<br />The explicit flag identifies songs with explicit lyrics or explicit title. We're able to identify explicit words and set the flag for the most common languages.<br />FAVOURITES<br />How many users have this song in their list of favourites.<br />Can be used to sort tracks by num favourite to identify more popular tracks within a set.<br />MUSIC GENRE<br />The music genere of the song.<br />Can be used to group songs by genre, as input for similarity alghorithms, artist genre identification, navigate songs by genere, etc.<br />SONG TITLES TRANSLATIONS<br />The track title, as translated in different lanauages, can be used to display the right writing for a given user, example:<br />LIES (Bigbang) becomes 在光化門 in chinese<br />HALLELUJAH (Bigbang) becomes ハレルヤ in japanese<br />Artist<br />Inside the artist object you can get the following nice extra information:<br />COMMENTS AND COUNTRY<br />An artist comment is a short snippet of text which can be mainly used for disambiguation.<br />The artist country is the born country of the artist/group<br />There are two perfect search result if you search by artist with the keyword \"U2\". Indeed there are two distinct music groups with this same name, one is the most known irish group of Bono Vox, the other is a less popular (world wide speaking) group from Japan.<br />Here's how you can made use of the artist comment in your search result page:<br />U2 (Irish rock band)<br />U2 (あきやまうに)<br />You can also show the artist country for even better disambiguation:<br />U2 (Irish rock band) from Ireland<br />U2 (あきやまうに) from Japan<br />ARTIST TRANSLATIONS<br />When you create a world wide music related service you have to take into consideration to display the artist name in the user's local language. These translation are also used as aliases to improve the search results.<br />Let's use PSY for this example.<br />Western people know him as PSY but korean want to see the original name 싸이.<br />Using the name translations provided by our api you can show to every user the writing they expect to see.<br />Furthermore, when you search for \"psy gangnam style\" or \"싸이 gangnam style\" with our search/match api you will still be able to find the song.<br />ARTIST RATING<br />The artist rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an artist in musixmatch.<br />You can use this information to build charts, for suggestions, to sort search results. In the example above about U2, we use the artist rating to show the irish band before the japanese one in our serp.<br />ARTIST MUSIC GENRE<br />We provide one or more main artist genre, this information can be used to calculate similar artist, suggestions, or the filter a search by artist genre.<br />Album<br />Inside the album object you can get the following nice extra information:<br />ALBUM RATING<br />The album rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an album in musixmatch.<br />You can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular albums of an artist.<br />ALBUM RATING<br />The album rating is a score 0-100 identifying how popular is an album in musixmatch.<br />You can use this information to sort search results, like the most popular albums of an artist.<br />ALBUM COPYRIGHT AND LABEL<br />For most of our albums we can provide extra information like for example:<br />Label: Universal-Island Records Ltd.<br />Copyright: (P) 2013 Rubyworks, under license to Columbia Records, a Division of Sony Music Entertainment.<br />ALBUM TYPE AND RELEASE DATE<br />The album official release date can be used to sort an artist's albums view starting by the most recent one.<br />Album can also be filtered or grouped by type: Single, Album, Compilation, Remix, Live. This can help to build an artist page with a more organized structure.<br />ALBUM MUSIC GENRE<br />For most of the albums we provide two groups of music genres. Primary and secondary. This information can be used to help user navigate albums by genre.<br />An example could be:<br />Primary genere: POP<br />Secondary genre: K-POP or Mandopop",

The specs are essentially duplicates from the Gateway and Bridge, but put together so as to make it clear to HIUs which set of APIs they should implement to participate in the network.<br /> The APIs are organized by the flows - identification, consent flow, data flow and monitoring. They represent the APIs that are expected to be available at the HIU end by the Gateway.<br /> For majority of the APIs, if Gateway has initiated a call, there are corresponding callback APIs on the Gateway. e.g for /consents/hiu/notify API on HIU end, its expected that a corresponding callback API /consents/hiu/on-notify on Gateway is called. Such APIs are organized under the Gateway label.<br /> Gateway relevant APIs for HIUs are grouped under Gateway label. These include the APIs that HIPs are required to call on the Gateway. For example, to request a CM for consent, HIU would call /consent-requests/init API on gateway.<br /> NOTE, in some of the API documentations below, X-HIP-ID is mentioned in header (for example in /auth/on-init). These are the cases, when a particular API is applicable for both HIU and HIP (e.g an entity is playing the role of HRP representing both HIU and HIP).

The API, in addition to search and autosuggest capabilities for finding datasets,<br />enables data based comparisons across geographical regions such as states, counties, metropolitan areas,<br />cities and zip codes using highly vetted data providers such as US Census, BEA, HUD and others. Comparison data<br />is preformatted for easy and efficient display on a chart, graph or interactive map.<br />The API also exposes data organized by narrative style questions a human might ask. The questions can<br />be rapidly found using an autosuggest style index, and then used to directly access all data needed to<br />thoroughly and authoritatively answer the question. Retrieved data includes time series (temporally aligned),<br />tabular, map heavy (includes spatial boundaries), and auto generated unstructured descriptive text.<br />The ODN API does not duplicate API endpoints or services provided by public sector agencies, but rather,<br />returns context relevant pre-populated REST URLs, when appropriate, so the caller can access data<br />directly from the source.<br />The open source API powers OpenDataNetwork.com, an open source<br />site; the site highlights myriad uses and provides API badges with contextually relevant API example<br />REST endpoints and documentation pointers.<br />Finally, we continuously add new dat sources which appear automatically in the API, so if your favorite data<br />source is not available, check back soon. You can also join us HERE<br />and receive updates or let us know which data sources you are most interested in.<br />App Tokens<br />Registering for and including a Socrata application token<br />is required for the ODN API.

This is achieved through standardization of entity identifiers that are used to exchange information among different services.<br />UML<br />UML Domain Model diagram you can find here.<br />Persistence<br />Entities are updated not more than 1 time per day.<br />Terms and Conditions<br />This OpenFinTech.io is made available under the Open Database License.<br />Any rights in individual contents of the database are licensed under the Database Contents License.<br />Contacts<br />For any questions, please email - info@openfintech.io<br />Or you can contact us at Gitter<br />Powered by Paymaxi<br />Get Started<br />If you use POSTMAN or similar program which can operate with swagger`s files - just download our spec and import it. Also you can try live API demo.<br />Overview<br />The OpenFinTech API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses HTTP response codes to indicate API errors.<br />API is based on JSON API standard. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors, although our API libraries convert responses to appropriate language-specific objects.<br />JSON API requires use of the JSON API media type (application/vnd.api+json) for exchanging data.<br />Additional Request Headers<br />ACCEPT HEADER<br />Your requests should always include the header:<br />If argument height or width is missing API returns original image with real sizes.<br />Errors<br />API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, etc.), and codes in the 5xx range indicate an error with OpenFinTech's servers (these are rare).<br />| Code | Description |<br />|------|-------------|<br />| 200 - OK\t| Everything worked as expected. |<br />| 400 - Bad Request |\tThe request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter. |<br />| 401 - Unauthorized |\tNo valid API key provided. |<br />| 402 - Request Failed\t| The parameters were valid but the request failed. |<br />| 404 - Not Found |\tThe requested resource doesn't exist. |<br />| 409 - Conflict\t| The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key). |<br />| 429 - Too Many Requests |\tToo many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests. |<br />| 500, 502, 503, 504 - Server Errors |\tSomething went wrong on OpenFinTech's end. (These are rare.) |",

      "description": "Introduction<br />Whether you're looking to build an official Pandascore integration for your service, or you just want to build something awesome, we can help you get started.<br />The API works over the HTTPS protocol, and is accessed from the api.pandascore.co domain.<br />The current endpoint is https://api.pandascore.co.<br />All data is sent and received as JSON by default.<br />Blank fields are included with null values instead of being omitted.<br />All timestamps are returned in ISO-8601 format<br />About this documentation<br />Clicking on a query parameter like filter or search will show you the available options: filter<br />You can also click on a response to see the detailed response schema: response<br />Events hierarchy<br />The PandaScore API allows you to access data about eSports events by using a certain structure detailed below.<br />Leagues<br />Leagues are the top level events. They don't have a date and represent a regular competition. A League is composed of one or several series.<br />Some League of Legends leagues are: EU LCS, NA LCS, LCK, etc.<br />Some Dota 2 leagues are: ESL One, GESC, The International, PGL, etc.<br />Series<br />A Serie represents an occurrence of a league event.<br />The EU LCS league has two series per year: spring 2017, summer 2017, spring 2016, summer 2016 etc.<br />Some Dota2 Series examples would be: Changsha Major, Open Bucharest, Frankfurt, i-League Invitational etc.<br />Tournaments<br />Tournaments groups all the matches of a serie under \"stages\" and \"groups\".<br />The tournaments of the EU LCS of summer 2017 are: Group A, Group B, Playoffs, etc.<br />Some Dota 2 tournaments are: Group A, Group B, Playoffs, etc.<br />Matches<br />Finally we have matches which have two players or teams (depending on the played videogame) and several games (the rounds of the match).<br />Matches of the group A in the EU LCS of summer 2017 are: G2 vs FNC, MSF vs NIP, etc.<br />Matches of the group A in the ESL One, Genting tournamnet are: Lower Round 1, Quarterfinal, Upper Final, etc.<br />Please note that some matches may be listed as \"TBD vs TBD\" if the matchup is not announced yet, for example the date of the Final match is known but the quarterfinal is still being played.<br />Structure<br />Formats<br />The API currently supports the JSON format by default.<br />Other formats may be added depending on user needs.<br />Pagination<br />The Pandascore API paginates all resources on the index method.<br />Requests that return multiple items will be paginated to 50 items by default. You can specify further pages with the page[number] parameter. You can also set a custom page size (up to 100) with the page[size] parameter.<br />The Link HTTP response header contains pagination data with first, previous, next and last raw page links when available, under the format<br />Sorting<br />All index endpoints support multiple sort fields with comma-separation (,); the fields are applied in the order specified.<br />The sort order for each field is ascending unless it is prefixed with a minus (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS, “-“), in which case it is descending.<br />For example, GET /lol/champions?sort=attackdamage,-name&token=YOURACCESSTOKEN will return all the champions sorted by attack damage.<br />Any champions with the same attack damage will then be sorted by their names in descending alphabetical order.<br />Rate limiting<br />Depending on your current plan, you will have a different rate limit. Your plan and your current request count are available on your dashboard.<br />With the free plan, you have a limit of 1000 requests per hour, others plans have a limit of 4000 requests per hour. The number of remaining requests is available in the X-Rate-Limit-Remaining response header.<br />Your API key is included in all the examples on this page, so you can test any example right away. Only you can see this value.<br />Authentication<br />The authentication on the Pandascore API works with access tokens.<br />All developers need to create an account before getting started, in order to get an access token. The access token should not be shared.<br />Your token can be found and regenerated from your dashboard.<br />The access token can be passed in the URL with the token query string parameter, or in the Authorization: Bearer header field.",

The Paylocity API uses HTTP verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure. OAuth 2.0 is used as the API Authorization framework. Request and response payloads are formatted as JSON.<br />Paylocity supports v1 and v2 versions of its API endpoints. v1, while supported, won't be enhanced with additional functionality. For direct link to v1 documentation, please click here. For additional resources regarding v1/v2 differences and conversion path, please contact webservices@paylocity.com.<br />Setup<br />Paylocity will provide the secure client credentials and set up the scope (type of requests and allowed company numbers). You will receive the unique client id, secret, and Paylocity public key for the data encryption. The secret will expire in 365 days.<br />Paylocity will send you an e-mail 10 days prior to the expiration date for the current secret. If not renewed, the second e-mail notification will be sent 5 days prior to secret's expiration. Each email will contain the code necessary to renew the client secret.<br />You can obtain the new secret by calling API endpoint using your current not yet expired credentials and the code that was sent with the notification email. For details on API endpoint, please see Client Credentials section.<br />Both the current secret value and the new secret value will be recognized during the transition period. After the current secret expires, you must use the new secret.<br />If you were unable to renew the secret via API endpoint, you can still contact Service and they will email you new secret via secure email.<br />When validating the request, Paylocity API will honor the defaults and required fields set up for the company default New Hire Template as defined in Web Pay.<br />Authorization<br />Paylocity Web Services API uses OAuth2.0 Authentication with JSON Message Format.<br />All requests of the Paylocity Web Services API require a bearer token which can be obtained by authenticating the client with the Paylocity Web Services API via OAuth 2.0.<br />The client must request a bearer token from the authorization endpoint:<br />auth-server for production: https://api.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token<br />auth-server for testing: https://apisandbox.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token<br />Paylocity reserves the right to impose rate limits on the number of calls made to our APIs. Changes to API features/functionality may be made at anytime with or without prior notice.<br />Authorization Header<br />The request is expected to be in the form of a basic authentication request, with the \"Authorization\" header containing the client-id and client-secret. This means the standard base-64 encoded user:password, prefixed with \"Basic\" as the value for the Authorization header, where user is the client-id and password is the client-secret.<br />Content-Type Header<br />The \"Content-Type\" header is required to be \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\".<br />Additional Values<br />The request must post the following form encoded values within the request body:<br /> granttype = clientcredentials<br /> scope = WebLinkAPI<br />Responses<br />Success will return HTTP 200 OK with JSON content:<br /> {<br /> \"access_token\": \"xxx\",<br /> \"expires_in\": 3600,<br /> \"token_type\": \"Bearer\"<br /> }<br />Encryption<br />Paylocity uses a combination of RSA and AES cryptography. As part of the setup, each client is issued a public RSA key.<br />Paylocity recommends the encryption of the incoming requests as additional protection of the sensitive data. Clients can opt-out of the encryption during the initial setup process. Opt-out will allow Paylocity to process unencrypted requests.<br />The Paylocity Public Key has the following properties:<br />2048 bit key size<br />PKCS1 key format<br />PEM encoding<br />Properties<br />key (base 64 encoded): The AES symmetric key encrypted with the Paylocity Public Key.

The Master Workspace identifier is the email you signed up with.<br />Default Template<br />Default template is a template that is available for all workspaces by default. You can set the template access type under Page Setup. If template has \"Organization\" access then your users can use them from the \"New\" menu in the Editor.<br />Data Field<br />Data Field is a placeholder for the specific data in your JSON data set. In this example JSON you can access the buyer name using Data Field {paymentDetails::buyerName}. The separator between depth levels is :: (two colons). When designing the template you don’t have to know every Data Field, our editor automatically extracts all the available fields from your data set and provides an easy way to insert them into the template.<br />Testing with JWTs<br />You can create a temporary token in Account Settings page after you login to PDF Generator API. The generated token uses your email address as the subject (sub) value and is valid for 5 minutes.<br />You can also use jwt.io to generate test tokens for your API calls. These test tokens should never be used in production applications.<br />Libraries and SDKs<br />Postman Collection<br />We have created a Postman Collection so you can easily test all the API endpoints wihtout developing and code.

Like Lorem Ipsum, but for user accounts and authentication.<br />The PhantAuth API documentation is available on the following API documentation sites:<br />apiary (primary source)<br />speca<br />PhantAuth Developer Portal<br />TL;DR<br />PhantAuth was designed to simplify testing for applications using OpenID Connect authentication by making use of random generated users.<br />endpoint | address<br />--------- | -------<br />issuer | https://phantauth.net<br />discovery | https://phantauth.net/.well-known/openid-configuration<br />credential | value<br />------------- | -----<br />client_id | test.client<br />client_secret | UTBcWwt5<br />OpenID Connect<br />The OpenID Connect Provider of PhantAuth supports the flows listed in the OpenID Connect specifications (Hybrid, Implicit, Authorization Code), as well as the Resource Owner Password grant type, specified in the OAuth 2.0 specifications. PhantAuth as an OpenID Connect Provider can be integrated with a variety of web applications, mobil applications, and backend applications. The integration can be either direct, as in the case of the OpenID Connect Provider, or through an authentication integration service, as in the case of Auth0 or Azure Active Directory B2C. To learn more, please go to chapter Integration.<br />Examples:<br />Direct OpenID Connect integration<br />Auth0 Social Connections integration<br />Azure Active Directory B2C integration<br />Random User<br />The random user generator of PhantAuth can also be used separately, independent of the OpenID Connect Provider. You can generate an optional number of test users. In the knowledge of their user name, the data of the generated users can be regenerated at any time (OpenID Connect sub claim). The generated users have a unique, operational, disposable email address, a profile picture selected from one of the multiple pools of pictures, and the usual profile data. Custom email addresses and profile pictures may also be added. The random user generator of PhantAuth can be fully customized. Additionally, you can link an external generator to the application. For details,please go to chapter Generator.<br />Test pages:<br />Default Generator Test Page (embedded generator)<br />Greek Gods Generator Test Page (embedded generator working from a Google Sheet)<br />Faker Generator Test Page (external generator using Javascript Faker library)<br />Chance Generator Test Page (external generator using Javascript Chance library)<br />Casual Generator Test Page (external generator using Javascript Casual library)<br />Randomuser Generator Test Page (client side generator using https://randomuser.me)<br />uinames Generator Test Page (client side generator using https://uinames.com)<br />Mockaroo Generator Test Page (client side generator using https://mockaroo.com)<br />Every random generated user has a profile page, which contains their profile data in a simple one-page format.<br />Profile examples:<br />Random Profile<br />Random Greek God Profile<br />Random Faker Profile<br />Random Chance Profile<br />Random Casual Profile<br />CodeSandbox<br />The use of the random user generator and the direct integration of the OpenID Connect is demonstrated through a set of CodeSandbox samples. The sample applications are run directly from CodeSandbox, so the source code is easy to view, edit, and test.<br />Examples:<br />Random User Generator usage exampe<br />OpenID Connect direct integration exampe<br />Tenants<br />The PhantAuth is extremely versatile and customizable. You can use your own random user service, or generate users from an external .csv file or Google Sheet. You can use a set of Bootstrap themes to tailor the look and feel of the profile, morover, you can fundamentally change the same look and feel by the use of your own HTML templates. To find out more, please go to chapter Tenant.<br />To customize the application, you need to use one or more so-called tenants. A tenant can be consiered as an independent PhantAuth service. A tenant has its own random user generator endpoints and OpenID Connect endpoints.<br />The tenants can be organised into so-called domains. Practically, a domain is a DNS zone, which contains the settings of the given tenant(s). The tenants as well as the domain can be configured by the use of DNS TXT records.<br />In addition to the default tenant, the PhantAuth domain contains some sample tenants, which are primarily designed to demonstrate customizability, a range of hosting possibilities, and the links to external services. In most cases, using the default tenant is enough.<br />PhantAuth Default - default tenant, based on a Java Fairy library<br />Greek Gods - based on a Google Sheet document<br />PhantAuth Faker - based on a Javascript Faker library, hosted at https://now.sh<br />PhantAuth Chance - based on a Javascript Chance library, hosted at https://now.sh<br />PhantAuth Casual - based on a Javascript Casual library, hosted at https://webtask.io<br />RANDOM USER - based on https://randomuser.me service<br />uinames - based on https://uinames.com service<br />Mockaroo - based on https://mockaroo.com service<br />Anyone can create a domain and the tenants. Sharing the tenants is facilitated by the PhantAuth Shared Domain. A shared domain is connected to the phantauth.cf DNS zone, where anyone can create tenant configuration nodes by the use of the FreeDNS service.<br />Concept<br />The internal structure of PhantAuth is modular enough to allow certain elements to be customized or even replaced. The customized PhantAuth instances can be considered as separate services, which are independent from the original one. For the sake of simplicity, the customized PhantAuth instances will be called tenants.<br />The customized PhantAuth instances (tenants) have a different URL from that of the default tenant. For technological and cloud hosting purposes, it is advised that only the beginning of the path component of these URLs differs from the default PhantAuth URL. Similarly, the path component of a tenant URL should start with a low line character (\"_\"). So the general format of a tenant URL is:<br />In the above example: The email address of the user generated by the user generator is ivan.test.szkiba@spam4.me (and his name is Ivan Test Szkiba). The profile page of this example can be found here.<br />Custom Generators<br />PhantAuth can use external data sources and generators as well. The only restriction is that the external generator has to be deterministic. This means that even if called several times, it has to generate the same object to the same identifier.<br />A special case of external generators is if an external data source is used. In such cases, the properties of a given object can be provided in a comma separated value (CSV) file or a Google Sheets document.<br />The external data sources and generators can be defined by the use of so-called tenants. To learn more, please go to chapter Tenant.",

An event can be anything that occurs in one venue at one given date and time: a concert, a play, a match, a conference, etc. Additionnally, you can explore the series: a series is just a group of events (e.g. a tour or a festival).<br />Once you retrieved the events you were interested in, you can look for the sales ( ticket counts):<br />Get a quick overview with /events/:id/ticket-counts<br />Or get a full insight by calling these endpoints:<br /> /events/:id/categories<br /> /events/:id/channels<br /> /events/:id/ticket-counts/detailed<br />Eventually, you may also want to fetch the promotions. A promotion can be anything meant to leverage the sales: ads, marketing campaigns, buzz or news around the event, etc. A promotion can be linked to any combination of events and/or series.",

It provides<br />continuous scanning of your Web Applications and lets you efficiently<br />manage the lifecycle of the vulnerabilities found, in a sleek and<br />intuitive web interface API.<br />Quick-Start<br />Authentication<br />To use the API, you first need to create a token (API Key).<br />To create a token, select a target from the drop-down list, go to the<br />\"Settings\" page, and click on the \"Integrations\" tab.<br />Write a name for the API Key. For example, if you want to use the API Key<br />for travis,<br />you could name it \"travis\". In this example, we chose \"example.com_key\"<br />Creating API key<br /> [1]: assets/qs/createapikey_1.png<br />The API key was created successfully:<br />API key created<br /> [2]: assets/qs/createapikey_2.png<br />On every request, you need to pass this token in the authorization header,<br />like this:<br />Concepts<br />The short version is that you run scans on targets, and findings are<br />created for any issue that is found.<br />However, there are a few more concepts that must be explained in order to<br />get a complete picture of how Probely works.<br />We will spend the next few sections detailing the most important concepts.<br />Target<br />A target defines the scope of a scan, what will and won't be included<br />in the scan plan.<br />This is done by filling a target's site and assets.<br />The entry point for the web application (and authentication) is setup<br />in the target's site.<br />In modern web applications, you are probably loading resources from<br />multiple domains.<br />A single page app, for example, will usualy load the page from one domain<br />and make AJAX requests to another.<br />This is what assets are for: they specify what domains our scanner should<br />follow and create requests for.<br />Site<br />A URL is probably not the only thing you will need to setup when scannning your application.<br />Does the application have an authenticated area? Does it use basic auth?<br />Does it expect a certain cookie or header?<br />These parameters are all configured in the target's site.<br />We need to ensure that only allowed web applications are scanned.<br />Therefore, we must verify that you have control of any site you wish to include.<br />This can be done by:<br /> Placing a file on a well-known location, on the site's server;<br /> Creating specific DNS records.<br />Asset<br />An asset is very similar to a site. The difference is that it is a domain instead<br />of a URL. Additionally, an asset has no login or basic auth support.<br />You can still have custom cookies and headers per asset.<br />As with the site, you will need to prove an asset's ownership. We have added some<br />rules to make your life easier, if you already have verified<br />a site and the domains match, the validation is fast-tracked.<br />Scans<br />This is what you're here for.<br />After configuring your target, you will want to run scans against it.<br />You can either start a one off scan, or schedule one for later - recurring<br />or not.<br />During the scan, we will spider and run several modules to check for<br />security issues, which we call findings.<br />You can check the findings even before a scan ends.<br />If everything goes well, the scan will complete and that is it.<br />With some findings, our automated processes may have difficulties<br />determining if it is a false positive or a legitimate issue.<br />In these instances, a scan will be marked as under review, and we will<br />further analyze the finding before making a decision.<br />We will only show findings that, for some degree of confidence, are true<br />positives.<br />A finding that we are not sure of will never be displayed.<br />As much as we try to prevent it, a scan (or a sub-module) can malfunction.<br />If this happens, a scan is marked as:<br /> \"failed\": the problem was irrecoverable;<br /> \"completed with errors\": some module failed but the scan itself completed.<br />During a scan, we try to determine what frameworks you are using<br />and add this information to the site and asset objects discussed<br />previously.<br />Findings<br />The last core concept is the finding, this is a security issue that<br />we have found during our scans.<br />If the same issue is found in a new scan it will not open a new finding but<br />update the previous.<br />A finding will have a lot of information about the issue.<br />Namely, where it was found, URL, insertion point (e.g. cookie), parameter,<br />and method.<br />Evidence we gathered, and the full request and response that we used.<br />Sugestions of how to go about fixing it.<br />A full description of the vulnerability is also present in the<br />definition property.<br />We also assign a severity and calculate the CVSS score for each.<br />Besides all this, there are also actions that you can perform on a finding.<br />You can assign it to one user, leave comments for your team or add labels,<br />and reduce or increase the severity.<br />If you don't plan on fixing the finding and accept the risk, or you think<br />we reported a false positive, you can mark the finding to reflect that.",

Backed by ContentDepot and its data model, MetaPub allows producers to supply metadata through various methods:<br />MetaPub Agents that collect producer metadata by \"crawling\" existing public feeds (e.g. C24, BBC) or the producer's production system (e.g. ATC, ME, TED Radio Hour).<br />Manually enter metadata in the ContentDepot Portal on each program and episode.<br />Publish/push the metadata to the MetaPub upload API and execute an ingest job.<br />MetaPub then distributes this data to stations through an electronic program guide (EPG model)<br />for display on various listener devices such as smart phones, tablets, web streams, HD radios, RDBS enabled FM radios, and more. The EPG format is based on the RadioDNS specifications.<br />RadioDNS and MetaPub<br />The RadioDNS Service and Programme Information Specification (TS 102 818 v3.1.1) defines three primary documents: Service Information, Program Information, and Group Information. These documents, along with the core RadioDNS Hybrid Lookup for Radio Services Specification (TS 103 270 v1.2.1) define a system where an end listener device can dynamically discover program metadata and fetch the metadata via Internet Protocol (IP) requests. MetaPub's use of RadioDNS differs slightly in that MetaPub (a.k.a PRSS) acts as the \"service provider\" while the stations and related middleware act as the end devices. While this is not the primary use case of RadioDNS, the flexibility in the specification, service definitions, and DNS resolution allows this model to be easily represented.<br />This documentation gives a high level overview of how the RadioDNS specifications will be used by MetaPub, however it is strongly recommended that the related RadioDNS specifications be read for implementation details, definitions, and required XML schemas.<br />ContentDepot Drive<br />ContentDepot Drive (CD Drive) provides a private, per customer file storage solution similar to other cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox. The CD Drive is used to stage content uploads such as metadata files, images, or segment audio before associating the content with specific programs or episodes.<br />CD Drive content can be referenced using a URI by some operations such as synchronizing metadata. There are two possible CD Drive URI formats supported: ID and hierarchical path. The ID reference takes the form . More information about URIs can be found at Wikipedia.<br />Authentication<br />The API currently uses OAuth 2.0.

      "description": "Download OpenAPI specification: openapi.yml<br />Introduction<br />Rudder exposes a REST API, enabling the user to interact with Rudder without using the webapp, for example in scripts or cronjobs.<br />Versioning<br />Each time the API is extended with new features (new functions, new parameters, new responses, ...), it will be assigned a new version number. This will allow you<br />to keep your existing scripts (based on previous behavior). Versions will always be integers (no 2.1 or 3.3, just 2, 3, 4, ...) or latest.<br />You can change the version of the API used by setting it either within the url or in a header:<br />the URL: each URL is prefixed by its version id, like /api/version/function.<br />Version 10<br /> curl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/10/rules<br />Latest<br /> curl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules<br />Wrong (not an integer) => 404 not found<br /> curl -X GET -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/3.14/rules<br />the HTTP headers. You can add the X-API-Version header to your request.

We use them to indicate what action will be done by the request. Currently, we use four of them:<br />GET: search or retrieve information (get rule details, get a group, ...)<br />PUT: add new objects (create a directive, clone a Rule, ...)<br />DELETE: remove objects (delete a node, delete a parameter, ...)<br />POST: update existing objects (update a directive, reload a group, ...)<br />Parameters<br />General parameters<br />Some parameters are available for almost all API functions. They will be described in this section.<br />They must be part of the query and can't be submitted in a JSON form.<br />Available for all requests<br />Field<br />Type<br />Description<br />prettify<br />boolean optional<br />Determine if the answer should be prettified (human friendly) or not. We recommend using this for debugging purposes, but not for general script usage as this does add some unnecessary load on the server side.<br />Default value: false<br />Available for modification requests (PUT/POST/DELETE)<br />Field<br />Type<br />Description<br />reason<br />string optional or required<br />Set a message to explain the change. If you set the reason messages to be mandatory in the web interface, failing to supply this value will lead to an error.<br />Default value:\"\"<br />changeRequestName<br />string optional<br />Set the change request name, is used only if workflows are enabled. The default value depends on the function called<br />Default value: A default string for each function<br />changeRequestDescription<br />string optional<br />Set the change request description, is used only if workflows are enabled.<br />Default value:\"\"<br />Passing parameters<br />Parameters to the API can be sent:<br />As part of the URL for resource identification<br />As data for POST/PUT requests<br /> Directly in JSON format<br /> As request arguments<br />As part of the URL for resource identification<br />Parameters in URLs are used to indicate which resource you want to interact with. The function will not work if this resource is missing.<br />Get the Rule of ID \"id\"<br /> curl -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/latest/rules/id<br />Sending data for POST/PUT requests<br />Directly in JSON format<br />JSON format is the preferred way to interact with Rudder API for creating or updating resources.<br />You'll also have to set the Content-Type header to application/json (without it the JSON content would be ignored).<br />In a curl POST request, that header can be provided with the -H parameter:<br /> curl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" ...<br />The supplied file must contain a valid JSON: strings need quotes, booleans and integers don't, etc.<br />The (human readable) format is:<br />Here is an example with inlined data:<br />Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive<br /> curl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"<br /> https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}<br /> -d '{ \"displayName\": \"new name\", \"enabled\": false, \"directives\": \"directiveId\"}'<br />You can also pass a supply the JSON in a file:<br />Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive<br /> curl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id} -d @jsonParam<br />Note that the general parameters view in the previous chapter cannot be passed in a JSON, and you will need to pass them a URL parameters if you want them to be taken into account (you can't mix JSON and request parameters):<br />Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive with reason message \"Reason used\"<br /> curl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \"https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}?reason=Reason used\" -d @jsonParam -d \"reason=Reason ignored\"<br />Request parameters<br />In some cases, when you have little, simple data to update, JSON can feel bloated. In such cases, you can use<br />request parameters. You will need to pass one parameter for each data you want to change.<br />Parameters follow the following schema:<br /> key=value<br />You can pass parameters by two means:<br />As query parameters: At the end of your url, put a ? then your first parameter and then a & before next parameters<br />Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive<br /> curl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\" https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id}?\"displayName=my new name\"&\"enabled=false\"&\"directives=aDirectiveId\"<br />As request data: You can pass those parameters in the request data, they won't figure in the URL, making it lighter to read, You can pass a file that contains data.<br />Update the Rule 'id' with a new name, disabled, and setting it one directive (in file directive-info.json)<br /> curl -X POST -H \"X-API-Token: yourToken\"<br /> https://rudder.example.com/rudder/api/rules/latest/{id} -d \"displayName=my new name\" -d \"enabled=false\" -d @directive-info.json",

You will need to setup three environment variables in PostMan - AccountId, ClientId and ClientSecret. Check out our PostMan blog post for more information<br />Run in Postman<br />Finding your client id, client secret and account id<br />To authenticate against the API's you will need three key pieces of data<br /> client id<br /> client secret<br /> account id<br />To retrieve these, simply login into https://hub.sakari.io and click on the \"cog\" in the top right corner. In the popup dialog at the bottom you should see your API credentials and account id. If these are not visible you will need to click on \"Request Credentials\"<br />Versioning<br />With any breaking changes we will introduce a new version of the API. The latest version is v1.<br />The API uses an open schema model, which means server may add extra properties to responses. Likewise, the server will ignore any extra query parameters and request body properties. When you write clients, you need to ignore additional properties in responses to ensure they do not break.<br />Testing<br />There are numerous tools available for testing the API's. We will include examples using curl and the client SDKs that we have created. If you would like to see an SDK in a language not currently available, please let us know.<br />Throttling / Limits<br />Our API's have been specifically designed to support bulk messaging in a single API call. We therefore impose limits on the frequency of calling the APIs to prevent abuse or runaway processes. If you feel you need a higher limit, please contact us. If you hit the limit you will get a 429 error code returned from our servers<br />Errors<br />The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of the API call. The body of the response will be JSON in the following format:<br />When making calls to the API, you can adjust the slice of data returned using query parameters such as:<br />` https://api.sakari.io/v1/accounts/123/contacts?offset=20&limit=25 `<br />This will return 25 contacts with an offset of 20.",

This header is used for<br />localizing cities and countries. The default language is English (en), but you can provide any of the languages<br />Spanish (es), French (fr), German (de), Portuguese (pt), Turkish (tr), Italian (it) or Polish (pl).<br />E.g. if you search a setlist for a concert that took place in Vienna and you pass \"de\" as header, you'll<br />get\"Wien, Österreich\" instead of\"Vienna, Austria\".<br />This also works if you use a different language than the country's native language.<br />E.g. for a concert in New York, you'll get\"Nueva York, Estados Unidos\" instead of\"New<br />York, United States\" if you pass \"es\" as language.<br />API Keys<br />API keys ( application form) must be included in the request with<br />the x-api-key header.<br />Version History<br />Version<br />Docs<br />End of Service<br />1.0<br />Docs<br />0.1<br />December 31, 2017",

      "description": "Introduction<br />The Shorten.rest API allows you to programmatically create short URLs (an 'alias') for longer URL (a 'destination').<br />Each alias you create can be used to redirect the end user (person clicking on the link) to one or more destination URLs<br />A default destination is always set and specific destinations can be set to redirect the end user to preferred destinations based on the user's geographical location (country) and device Operating System.<br />In order to use the Shorten.Rest URL Shortening API you can choose to bind your own branded domain, sub-domain or to use our default domain - Short.FYI<br />Destination Matching<br /> When creating or editing a short URL ('alias') you can choose to specify a destination for each country and OS (Supported OSes list) combination.<br /> When a user clicks on the short link, Shorten.rest will examine the end user's country (determined by User's IP) and OS (User agent) and match the most suitable destination for each user.<br /> (*) If no destination is set for a specific request combination Shorten.rest will use the default destination that exists within each short URL<br /> (**) BRANDED DOMAINS: If the requested alias does not exist in our database - Shorten.rest will redirect the user to the default fallback you set within your dashboard under the ‘Alias Not Found Page Url’ value for a custom domain.<br /> (*) Operating System (OS) destinations are stronger than a country destination!<br /> For example - if you have a custom landing page that is targeting people in the USA and a second landing page that is hyper focused for people who use iOS devices - a person clicking on your link in the USA that is on an iPhone will be redirected to the iOS landing page, while all other devices will be redirected to the USA landing page.<br /> | OS | Country | Destination |<br />| :------------: |:---------------:| -----|<br />| iOS | | YourDestination.com/ios |<br />| | US | YourDestination.com/usa |<br /> Shorten.rest will choose the YourDestination.com/ios url as the most suitable destination.<br />Branded Domain Attributes<br /> When setting up your custom domain you can include optional metatags and snippets (Supported snippets list). These parameters (such as retargeting, tracking and conversion pixels) are populated and fired on click - at the time of the redirect.<br /> By default the parameters you set in the domain setting will be included in all Short URLs associated with that domain.<br /> You can always override the domain defaults for each URL by passing the appropriate variables when creating or updating a short URL<br />Setting a Custom string for an Alias (short.fyi/alias)<br /> While creating a short URL you can specify which domain to use. You can choose to use your own branded domain or our default domain - Short.fyi.<br /> Each Alias is unique within a domain they are related to. This means that if multiple accounts use you the same domain (for example short.fyi), if an alias is already taken you may not create a new destination for it.<br /> That said - If you would like to use a specific alias which is already taken - the only way to do so is to create it on a new domain you own and have attached to your Shorten.rest account.<br />Random Aliases<br /> By default - unless you specify a vanity URI for your alias each URL that is shortened on our platform will have a random string generated by the API. This means that if the 'alias' attribute of a /aliases POST request is not provided, or is an empty string, a random string of seven characters will be generated and returned as part of the POST response.<br /> You can also place the @rnd macro within the alias field when you create a new alias, for example /vanity/@rnd, which might return an alias like /vanity/ZMAefRt, or /vanity@rnd, which might produce something like /vanityMRtvxadf. Only the first @rnd in an alias attribute will be replaced.<br />NOTES<br /> ( * ) All methods of the Shorten.REST API require that your API key be provided in x-api-key header.<br /> (**) All API parameters are case sensitive",

To get set up with the API using live MLS data, you<br />must have RETS credentials from your MLS, which you can then use to<br />create an app with SimplyRETS. For more information on that<br />process, please see our FAQ, [Getting<br />Started](https://simplyrets.com/blog/getting-set-up.html) page, or<br />contact us.<br />Below you'll find the API endpoints, query parameters, response bodies,<br />and other information about using the SimplyRETS API. You can run<br />queries by clicking the 'Try it Out' button at the bottom of each<br />section.<br />Authentication<br />The SimplyRETS API uses Basic Authentication. When you create an<br />app, you'll get a set of API credentials to access your<br />listings. If you're trying out the test data, you can use<br />simplyrets:simplyrets for connecting to the API.<br />Media Types<br />The SimplyRETS API uses the Accept header to allow clients to<br />control media types (content versions). We maintain backwards<br />compatibility with API clients by allowing them to specify a<br />content version. We highly recommend setting and explicity media<br />type when your application reaches production. Both the structure<br />and content of our API response bodies is subject to change so we<br />can add new features while respecting the stability of applications<br />which have already been developed.<br />To always use the latest SimplyRETS content version, simply use<br />application/json in your application Accept header.<br />If you want to pin your clients media type to a specific version,<br />you can use the vendor-specific SimplyRETS media type, e.g.<br />application/vnd.simplyrets-v0.1+json\"<br />To view all valid content-types for making an OPTIONS, make a<br />request to the SimplyRETS api root<br />curl -XOPTIONS -u simplyrets:simplyrets https://api.simplyrets.com/<br />The default media types used in our API responses may change in the<br />future. If you're building an application and care about the<br />stability of the API, be sure to request a specific media type in the<br />Accept header as shown in the examples below.<br />The wordpress plugin automatically sets the Accept header for the<br />compatible SimplyRETS media types.<br />Pagination<br />To paginate through listings, start your query with these<br />parameters: 'limit=500&lastId=0'. The 'lastId' is the important<br />part, you can use any limit up to 500. When you receive the<br />response from the API with the results, check the 'Link' header for<br />the 'next' link. That link is pre-built to access the next 'page'<br />of listings. Alternatively, you can use the last listing's 'mlsId'<br />from the previous request and use that in the next query. For<br />example:<br />First query:<br />curl -u username:password 'https://api.simplyrets.com/properties?limit=500&lastId=0'<br />If the 'mlsId' in the last listing of the results is '1234567', then the next query will be:<br />curl -u username:password 'https://api.simplyrets.com/properties?limit=500&lastId=1234567'<br />...and so one until you have reached the final page of listings.<br />There a few pieces of useful information about each request stored<br />in the HTTP Headers:<br />X-Total-Count shows you the total amount of listings that match<br /> your current query.<br />Link contains pre-built pagination links for accessing the next<br />'page' of listings that match your query.<br />RETS Vendor Compliance<br />Many RETS vendors have strict requirements for showing disclaimers<br />with specific information embedded. For example, in many areas it's<br />required to show the timestamp of the time the listings were<br />refreshed inside a disclaimer or on a listing page.<br />The timestamp of the last listing refresh timestamp can be found in<br />one of two spots:<br />The X-SimplyRETS-LastUpdate header from GET /properties or GET /properties/{mlsId}<br />Calling the API root / or properties api endpoint /properties<br /> with an OPTIONS request<br /> OPTIONS /<br /> This request will show the last update timestamp for all RETS<br /> vendors associated with your application. Look for the<br /> updates list in the JSON response.<br /> OPTIONS /properties<br /> Using this request, look for the lastUpdate field in the JSON<br /> response.",

It is important to note that for many package managers, using this API will be less accurate than running the Snyk CLI as part of your build pipe, or just using it locally on your package. The reason for this is that more than one package version fit the requirements given in manifest files. Running the CLI locally tests the actual deployed code, and has an accurate snapshot of the dependency versions in use, while the API can only infer it, with inferior accuracy. It should be noted that the Snyk CLI has the ability to output machine-readable JSON output (with the --json flag to snyk test).<br />A third option, is to allow Snyk access to your development flow via the existing Snyk integrations. The advantage to this approach is having Snyk monitor every new pull request, and suggest fixes by opening new pull requests. This can be achieved either by integrating Snyk directly to your source code management (SCM) tool, or via a broker to allow greater security and auditability.<br />If those are not viable options, this API is your best choice.<br />API url<br />The base URL for all API endpoints is https://snyk.io/api/v1/<br />Authorization<br />To use this API, you must get your token from Snyk.

JSON will be returned in all responses from the API, including errors (though if you're using API bindings, we will convert the response to the appropriate language-specific object).

At the moment, you may only pass one language abbreviation in the header at a time. Valid language abbreviations can be found at the /languages route..<br />Authentication<br />Authentication to use the API is similar to the How-to section above. Users must POST to the /login route with their API key and credentials in the following format in order to obtain a JWT token.<br />{\"apikey\":\"APIKEY\",\"username\":\"USERNAME\",\"userkey\":\"USERKEY\"}<br />Note that the username and key are ONLY required for the /user routes. The user's key is labled Account Identifier in the account section of the main site.<br />The token is then used in all subsequent requests by providing it in the Authorization header. The header will look like: Authorization: Bearer . Currently, the token expires after 24 hours. You can GET the /refresh_token route to extend that expiration date.<br />Versioning<br />You may request a different version of the API by including an Accept header in your request with the following format: Accept:application/vnd.thetvdb.v$VERSION.

      "description": "Tisane is a natural language processing library, providing:<br />standard NLP functionality<br />special functions for detection of problematic or abusive content<br />low-level NLP like morphological analysis and tokenization of no-space languages (Chinese, Japanese, Thai)<br />Tisane has monolithic architecture. All the functions are exposed using the same language models and the same analysis process invoked using the POST /parse method. Other methods in the API are either wrappers based on the process, helper methods, or allow inspection of the language models.<br />The current section of the documentation describes the two structures used in the parsing & transformation methods.<br />Getting Started<br />This guide describes how to setup your Tisane account. The steps you need to complete are as follows:<br />Step 1 – Create an Account<br />Step 2 – Save Your API Key<br />Step 3 – Integrate the API<br />Step 1 – Create an Account<br />Navigate to Sign up to Tisane API. The free Community Plan allows up to 50,000 requests but comes with a limitation of 10 requests per minute.<br />Step 2 - Save Your API Key<br />You will need the API key to make requests. Open your Developer Profile to find your API keys.<br />Step 3 - Integrate with the API<br />In summary, the POST /parse method has 3 attributes: content, language, and settings. All 3 attributes are mandatory.<br />For example:<br />{\"language\": \"en\", \"content\": \"hello\", \"settings\": {}}<br />Read on for more info on the response and the settings specs. The method doc pages contain snippets of code for your favorite languages and platforms.<br />Response Reference<br />The response of the POST /parse method contains several sections displayed or hidden according to the settings provided.<br />The common attributes are:<br />text (string) - the original input<br />reduced_output (boolean) - if the input is too big, and verbose information like the lexical chunk was requested, the verbose information will not be generated, and this flag will be set to true and returned as part of the response<br />sentiment (floating-point number) - a number in range -1 to 1 indicating the document-level sentiment. Only shown when document_sentiment setting is set to true.<br />signal2noise (floating-point number) - a signal to noise ranking of the text, in relation to the array of concepts specified in the relevant setting. Only shown when the relevant setting exists.<br />Abusive or Problematic Content<br />The abuse section is an array of detected instances of content that may violate some terms of use. NOTE: the terms of use in online communities may vary, and so it is up to the administrators to determine whether the content is indeed abusive. For instance, it makes no sense to restrict sexual advances in a dating community, or censor profanities when it's accepted in the bulk of the community.<br />The section exists if instances of abuse are detected and the abuse setting is either omitted or set to true.<br />Every instance contains the following attributes:<br />offset (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the instance starts<br />length (unsigned integer) - length of the content<br />sentence_index (unsigned integer) - zero-based index of the sentence containing the instance<br />text (string) - fragment of text containing the instance (only included if the snippets setting is set to true)<br />tags (array of strings) - when exists, provides additional detail about the abuse. For instance, if the fragment is classified as an attempt to sell hard drugs, one of the tags will be harddrug_.<br />type (string) - the type of the abuse<br />severity (string) - how severe the abuse is. The levels of severity are low, medium, high, and extreme<br />explanation (string) - when available, provides rationale for the annotation; set the explain setting to true to enable.<br />The currently supported types are:<br />personal_attack - an insult / attack on the addressee, e.g. an instance of cyberbullying. Please note that an attack on a post or a point, or just negative sentiment is not the same as an insult. The line may be blurred at times. See our Knowledge Base for more information.<br />bigotry - hate speech aimed at one of the protected classes. The hate speech detected is not just racial slurs, but, generally, hostile statements aimed at the group as a whole<br />profanity - profane language, regardless of the intent<br />sexual_advances - welcome or unwelcome attempts to gain some sort of sexual favor or gratification<br />criminal_activity - attempts to sell or procure restricted items, criminal services, issuing death threats, and so on<br />external_contact - attempts to establish contact or payment via external means of communication, e.g. phone, email, instant messaging (may violate the rules in certain communities, e.g. gig economy portals, e-commerce portals)<br />adult_only - activities restricted for minors (e.g. consumption of alcohol)<br />mental_issues - content indicative of suicidal thoughts or depression<br />spam - (RESERVED) spam content<br />generic - undefined<br />Sentiment Analysis<br />The sentiment_expressions section is an array of detected fragments indicating the attitude towards aspects or entities.<br />The section exists if sentiment is detected and the sentiment setting is either omitted or set to true.<br />Every instance contains the following attributes:<br />offset (unsigned integer) - zero-based offset where the instance starts<br />length (unsigned integer) - length of the content<br />sentence_index (unsigned integer) - zero-based index of the sentence containing the instance<br />text (string) - fragment of text containing the instance (only included if the snippets setting is set to true)<br />polarity (string) - whether the attitude is positive, negative, or mixed. Additionally, there is a default sentiment used for cases when the entire snippet has been pre-classified. For instance, if a review is split into two portions, What did you like? and What did you not like?, and the reviewer replies briefly, e.g. The quiet. The service, the utterance itself has no sentiment value. When the calling application is aware of the intended sentiment, the default sentiment simply provides the targets / aspects, which will be then added the sentiment externally.<br />targets (array of strings) - when available, provides set of aspects and/or entities which are the targets of the sentiment. For instance, when the utterance is, The breakfast was yummy but the staff is unfriendly, the targets for the two sentiment expressions are meal and staff. Named entities may also be targets of the sentiment.<br />reasons (array of strings) - when available, provides reasons for the sentiment. In the example utterance above (The breakfast was yummy but the staff is unfriendly), the reasons array for the staff is [\"unfriendly\"], while the reasons array for meal is [\"tasty\"].<br />explanation (string) - when available, provides rationale for the sentiment; set the explain setting to true to enable.<br />Example:<br />Context-Aware Spelling Correction<br />Tisane supports automatic, context-aware spelling correction. Whether it's a misspelling or a purported obfuscation, Tisane attempts to deduce the intended meaning, if the language model does not recognize the word.<br />When or if it's found, Tisane adds the correctedtext attribute to the word (if the words / lexical chunks are returned) and the sentence (if the sentence text is generated). Sentence-level correctedtext is displayed if words or parses are set to true.<br />Note that as Tisane works with large dictionaries, you may need to exclude more esoteric terms by using the mingenericfrequency setting.<br />Note that the invocation of spell-checking does not depend on whether the sentences and the words sections are generated in the output. The spellchecking can be disabled by setting disablespellcheck to true. Another option is to enable the spellchecking for lowercase words only, thus excluding potential proper nouns in languages that support capitalization; to avoid spell-checking capitalized and uppercase words, set lowercasespellcheck_only to true.<br />Settings Reference<br />The purpose of the settings structure is to:<br /> provide cues about the content being sent to improve the results<br /> customize the output and select sections to be shown<br /> define standards and formats in use<br /> define and calculate the signal to noise ranking<br />All settings are optional. To leave all settings to default, simply provide an empty object ({}).<br />Content Cues and Instructions<br />format (string) - the format of the content. Some policies will be applied depending on the format. Certain logic in the underlying language models may require the content to be of a certain format (e.g. logic applied on the reviews may seek for sentiment more aggressively). The default format is empty / undefined. The format values are:<br />review - a review of a product or a service or any other review. Normally, the underlying language models will seek for sentiment expressions more aggressively in reviews.<br />dialogue - a comment or a post which is a part of a dialogue. An example of a logic more specific to a dialogue is name calling. A single word like \"idiot\" would not be a personal attack in any other format, but it is certainly a personal attack when part of a dialogue.<br />shortpost - a microblogging post, e.g. a tweet.<br />longform - a long post or an article.<br />proofread - a post which was proofread. In the proofread posts, the spellchecking is switched off.<br />alias - a nickname in an online community.<br />search - a search query. Search queries may not always be grammatically correct. Certain topics and items, that we may otherwise let pass, are tagged with the search format.<br />disable_spellcheck (boolean) - determines whether the automatic spellchecking is to be disabled. Default: false.<br />lowercasespellcheckonly (boolean) - determines whether the automatic spellchecking is only to be applied to words in lowercase. Default: false<br />mingenericfrequency (int) - allows excluding more esoteric terms; the valid values are 0 thru 10.<br />subscope (boolean) - enables sub-scope parsing, for scenarios like hashtag, URL parsing, and obfuscated content (e.g. ihateyou). Default: false.<br />domainfactors (set of pairs made of strings and numbers) - provides a session-scope cues for the domains of discourse. This is a powerful tool that allows tailoring the result based on the use case. The format is, family ID of the domain as a key and the multiplication factor as a value (e.g. \"12345\": 5.0). For example, when processing text looking for criminal activity, we may want to set domains relevant to drugs, firearms, crime, higher: \"domainfactors\": {\"31058\": 5.0, \"45220\": 5.0, \"14112\": 5.0, \"14509\": 3.0, \"28309\": 5.0, \"43220\": 5.0, \"34581\": 5.0}. The same device can be used to eliminate noise coming from domains we know are irrelevant by setting the factor to a value lower than 1.<br />when (date string, format YYYY-MM-DD) - indicates when the utterance was uttered. (TO BE IMPLEMENTED) The purpose is to prune word senses that were not available at a particular point in time. For example, the words troll, mail, and post had nothing to do with the Internet 300 years ago because there was no Internet, and so in a text that was written hundreds of years ago, we should ignore the word senses that emerged only recently.<br />Output Customization<br />abuse (boolean) - output instances of abusive content (default: true)<br />sentiment (boolean) - output sentiment-bearing snippets (default: true)<br />document_sentiment (boolean) - output document-level sentiment (default: false)<br />entities (boolean) - output entities (default: true)<br />topics (boolean) - output topics (default: true), with two more relevant settings:<br /> topic_stats (boolean) - include coverage statistics in the topic output (default: false). When set, the topic is an object containing the attributes topic (string) and coverage (floating-point number). The coverage indicates a share of sentences touching the topic among all the sentences.<br /> optimize_topics (boolean) - if true, the less specific topics are removed if they are parts of the more specific topics. For example, when the topic is cryptocurrency, the optimization removes finance.<br />words (boolean) - output the lexical chunks / words for every sentence (default: false). In languages without white spaces (Chinese, Japanese, Thai), the tokens are tokenized words. In languages with compounds (e.g. German, Dutch, Norwegian), the compounds are split.<br /> fetch_definitions (boolean) - include definitions of the words in the output (default: false). Only relevant when the words setting is true<br />parses (boolean) - output parse forests of phrases<br />deterministic (boolean) - whether the n-best senses and n-best parses are to be output in addition to the detected sense. If true, only the detected sense will be output. Default: true<br />snippets (boolean) - include the text snippets in the abuse, sentiment, and entities sections (default: false)<br />explain (boolean) - if true, a reasoning for the abuse and sentiment snippets is provided when possible (see the explanation attribute)<br />Standards and Formats<br />feature_standard (string) - determines the standard used to output the features (grammar, style, semantics) in the response object. The standards we support are:<br />ud: Universal Dependencies tags (default)<br />penn: Penn treebank tags<br />native: Tisane native feature codes<br />description: Tisane native feature descriptions<br />Only the native Tisane standards (codes and descriptions) support style and semantic features.<br />topic_standard (string) - determines the standard used to output the topics in the response object. The standards we support are:<br />iptc_code - IPTC topic taxonomy code<br />iptc_description - IPTC topic taxonomy description<br />iab_code - IAB topic taxonomy code<br />iab_description - IAB topic taxonomy description<br />native - Tisane domain description, coming from the family description (default)<br />sentimentanalysistype (string) - (RESERVED) the type of the sentiment analysis strategy. The values are:<br />productsandservices - most common sentiment analysis of products and services<br />entity - sentiment analysis with entities as targets<br />creativecontentreview - reviews of creative content<br />political_essay - political essays<br />Signal to Noise Ranking<br />When we're studying a bunch of posts commenting on an issue or an article, we may want to prioritize the ones more relevant to the topic, and containing more reason and logic than emotion. This is what the signal to noise ranking is meant to achieve.<br />The signal to noise ranking is made of two parts:<br />Determine the most relevant concepts. This part may be omitted, depending on the use case scenario (e.g. we want to track posts most relevant to a particular set of issues).<br />Rank the actual post in relevance to these concepts.<br />To determine the most relevant concepts, we need to analyze the headline or the article itself. The headline is usually enough. We need two additional settings:<br />keyword_features (an object of strings with string values) - determines the features to look for in a word. When such a feature is found, the family ID is added to the set of potentially relevant family IDs.<br />stophypernyms (an array of integers) - if a potentially relevant family ID has a hypernym listed in this setting, it will not be considered. For example, we extracted a set of nouns from the headline, but we may not be interested in abstractions or feelings. E.g. from a headline like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas_ we want Las Vegas only. Optional.<br />If keyword_features is provided in the settings, the response will have a special attribute, relevant, containing a set of family IDs.<br />At the second stage, when ranking the actual posts or comments for relevance, this array is to be supplied among the settings. The ranking is boosted when the domain, the hypernyms, or the families related to those in the relevant array are mentioned, when negative and positive sentiment is linked to aspects, and penalized when the negativity is not linked to aspects, or abuse of any kind is found. The latter consideration may be disabled, e.g. when we are looking for specific criminal content. When the abusenotnoise parameter is specified and set to true, the abuse is not penalized by the ranking calculations.<br />To sum it up, in order to calculate the signal to noise ranking:<br />Analyze the headline with keywordfeatures and, optionally, stophypernyms in the settings. Obtain the relevant attribute.<br />When analyzing the posts or the comments, specify the relevant attribute obtained in step 1.",

You may also want to check out our Validations API docs or our Signals API docs.<br />Truora Check API allows performing full background checks on people, vehicles and companies. There are three main types of background checks:<br />Personal background check: Verifies national IDs in multiple databases of public and legal entities in the LATAM region. For every national ID, returns information on: personal identity, criminal records, international background check, and professional background.<br />Vehicle background check: Verifies the vehicle documents and the owner identity in multiple databases of public and legal entities in the LATAM region. For every vehicle and owner type, returns information on: personal identity, driving records, criminal records, and vehicle information.<br />Company background check: Verifies the tax ID or a company name in multiple databases of public and legal entities in the LATAM region. For every company, returns the associated: business status, legal and criminal records, and media reports.<br />API Key V1 is live!<br />API key version 1 is now live. Users with version 0 API keys are not immediately required to upgrade to V1 but should plan to do so at their earliest convenience. The changes for integration with API keys v1 are as follows:<br />The field `user_authorized` is now required to perform person checks. This field indicates the API user has authorization to perform the check in compliance with data protection law.<br />The field `homonym_scores` is no longer included in our person check response as its results are already included in the body of the check and keeping them duplicated is generating unnecessary confusion.<br />API composition<br />Endpoints<br />Check endpoints: Provide an easy way to create and search for a background check. They also allow inserting groups of checks into reports. Each check contains scores, datasets and databases.<br />SDKs<br />If your favorite language was not on the next list, You can use our OpenAPI 3 spec to generate it using the Open API Generator.<br />To download the SDK click on the desired programming language:<br />C# .Net Core<br />Elixir<br />Go<br />Java<br />JavaScript<br />Objc<br />Php<br />Python<br />Ruby<br />You can see the full list of supported platforms here:<br />https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators",

      "description": "Overview<br />The Fitbit Plus API is a RESTful API. The requests and responses are formated according to the<br />JSON API specification.<br />In addition to this documentation, we also provide an<br />OpenAPI \"yaml\" file describing the API:<br />Fitbit Plus API Specification.<br />Authentication<br />Authentication for the Fitbit Plus API is based on the<br />OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework. Fitbit Plus currently supports grant<br />types of clientcredentials and refreshtoken.<br />See POST /oauth/token for details on the request and response formats.<br />Building Integrations<br />We will provide customers with unique client credentials for each application/integration they build, allowing us<br />to enforce appropriate access controls and monitor API usage.<br />The client credentials will be scoped to the organization, and allow full access to all patients and related data<br />within that organization.<br />These credentials are appropriate for creating an integration that does one of the following:<br /> background reporting/analysis<br /> synchronizing data with another system (such as an EMR)<br />The API credentials and oauth flows we currently support are not well suited for creating a user-facing<br />application that allows a user (patient, coach, or admin) to login and have access to data which is appropriate to<br />that specific user. It is possible to build such an application, but it is not possible to use Fitbit Plus as a<br />federated identity provider. You would need to have a separate means of verifying a user's identity. We do not<br />currently support the required password-based oauth flow to make this possible.<br />Paging<br />The Fitbit Plus API supports two different pagination strategies for GET collection endpoints.<br />Skip-based paging<br />Skip-based paging uses the query parameters page[size] and page[number] to specify the max number of resources returned and the page number. We default to skip-based paging if there are no page parameters. The response will include a links object containing links to the first, last, prev, and next pages of data.<br />If the contents of the collection change while you are iterating through the collection, you will see duplicate or missing documents. For example, if you are iterating through the calenderevent resource via GET /pub/calendarevent?sort=startat&page[size]=50&page[number]=1, and a new calendarevent is created that has a startat value before the first calendarevent, when you fetch the next page at GET /pub/calendarevent?sort=startat&page[size]=50&page[number]=2, the first entry in the second response will be a duplicate of the last entry in the first response.<br />Cursor-based paging<br />Cursor-based paging uses the query parameters page[limit] and page[after] to specify the max number of entries returned and identify where to begin the next page. Add page[limit] to the parameters to use cursor-based paging. The response will include a links object containing a link to the next page of data, if the next page exists.<br />Cursor-based paging is not subject to duplication if new resources are added to the collection. For example, if you are iterating through the calenderevent resource via GET /pub/calendarevent?sort=startat&page[limit]=50, and a new calendarevent is created that has a startat value before the first calendarevent, you will not see a duplicate entry when you fetch the next page at GET /pub/calendarevent?sort=startat&page[limit]=50&page[after]= .<br />We encourage the use of cursor-based paging for performance reasons.<br />In either form of paging, you can determine whether any resources were missed by comparing the number of fetched resources against meta.count. Set page[size] or page[limit] to 0 to get only the count.<br />It is not valid to mix the two strategies.",

      "description": "The Benefits Intake API allows authorized third-party systems used by Veteran Service Organizations (VSOs), agencies, and Veterans to digitally submit VA benefits claim documents directly to the Veterans Benefits Administration's (VBA) claims intake process. This API handles documents related to the following benefit claim types:<br />Compensation<br />Pension/Survivors Benefits<br />Education<br />Fiduciary<br />Insurance<br />Veteran Readiness & Employment (VRE)<br />Board of Veteran Appeals (BVA)<br />This API also provides submission status updates until documents are successfully established for VBA claim processing, eliminating the need for users to switch between systems to manually check whether documents have been successfully uploaded.<br />Background<br />This API provides a secure, efficient, and tracked alternative to mail or fax for VA benefit claim document submissions. Documents are uploaded directly to the VBA so they can be processed as quickly as possible.<br />Technical overview<br />The Benefits Intake API first provides an upload location and unique submission identifier, and then accepts a payload consisting of a document in PDF format, zero or more optional attachments in PDF format, and some JSON metadata.<br />The metadata describes the document and attachments, and identifies the person for whom it is being submitted. This payload is encoded as binary multipart/form-data (not base64). The unique identifier supplied with the payload can subsequently be used to request the processing status of the uploaded document package.<br />To avoid errors and processing delays, API consumers are encouraged to validate the zipcode,fileNumber, veteranFirstName, veteranLastName and businessLine fields before submission according to their description in the DocumentUploadMetadata model and use the 'businessLine' attribute for the most efficient processing. Additionally, please ensure no PDF user or owner passwords are used in submitted PDFs.<br />Attachment & file size limits<br />There is no limit on the number of files a payload can contain, but size limits do apply.<br />Uploaded documents cannot be larger than 21\" x 21\"<br />The entire payload cannot exceed 5 GB<br />No single file in a payload can exceed 100 MB<br />Date of receipt<br />The date that documents are successfully submitted through the Benefits Intake API is used as the official VA date of receipt. However, note that until a document status of received, processing, success, or vbms is returned, a client cannot consider the document received by VA.<br />A status of received means that the document package has been transmitted, but may not be validated. Any errors with the document package, such as unreadable PDFs or a Veteran not found, will cause the status to change to error.<br />If the document status is error, VA has not received the submission and cannot honor the submission date as the date of receipt.<br />Authentication and Authorization<br />API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name 'apikey'. Request an API key.<br />Testing in the sandbox environment<br />In the sandbox environment, the final status of a submission is received and submissions do not actually progress to the central mail repository or VBMS.<br />Progress beyond the received status can be simulated for testing. We allow passing in a Status-Override header on the /uploads/{id} endpoint so that you can change the status of your submission to simulate the various scenarios.<br />The available statuses are pending, uploaded, received, processing, success, vbms, and error. The meaning of the various statuses is listed below in Models under DocumentUploadStatusAttributes.<br />Test data<br />We use mock test data in the sandbox environment. Data is not sent upstream and it is not necessary to align submitted test data with any other systems' data.<br />Upload operation<br />Allows a client to upload a multi-part document package (form + attachments + metadata).<br />Client Request: POST https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/vba_documents/v1/<br /> No request body or parameters required<br />Service Response: A JSON API object with the following attributes:<br /> guid: An identifier used for subsequent status requests<br /> location: A URL to which the actual document package payload can be submitted in the next step. The URL is specific to this upload request, and should not be re-used for subsequent uploads. The URL is valid for 900 seconds (15 minutes) from the time of this response. If the location is not used within 15 minutes, the GUID will expire. Once expired, status checks on the GUID will return a status of expired.<br /> Note: If, after you've submitted a document, the status hasn't changed to uploaded before 15 minutes has elapsed, we recommend retrying the upload in order to make sure the document properly reaches our servers. If the upload continues to fail, try encoding the payload as Base64 (See below).<br /> Client Request: PUT to the location URL returned in Step 2.<br /> Request body should be encoded as binary multipart/form-data (base64 also available - see details below), equivalent to that generated by an HTML form submission or using “curl -F…”. The format is described in more detail below.<br /> No apikey authorization header is required for this request, as authorization is embedded in the signed location URL.<br />Service Response: The HTTP status indicates whether the upload was successful.<br /> Additionally, the response includes an ETag header containing an MD5 hash of the submitted payload. This can be compared to the submitted payload to ensure data integrity of the upload.<br />Status caching<br />Due to current system limitations, data for the /uploads/report endpoint is cached for one hour.<br />A request to the /uploads/{id} endpoint will return a real-time status for that GUID, and update its status in /uploads/report.<br />The updated_at field indicates the last time the status for a given GUID was updated.<br />Optional Base64 encoding<br />Base64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into text format, so that encoded textual data can be easily transported over networks uncorrupted and without data loss.<br />Base64 can be used to encode binary multipart/form-data it in its entirety. Note that the whole payload must be encoded, not individual parts/attachments.<br />After encoding your payload, you'll be required to preface your base64 string with data:multipart/form-data;base64, in order to allow our system to distinguish the file type. Your final string payload would look something like data:multipart/form-data;base64,(encryption string)== and close with the standard == marker. Note that the multipart boundaries i.e. -----WebKitFormBoundaryVfOwzCyvug0JmWYo and ending ------WebKitFormBoundaryVfOwzCyvug0JmWYo- must also be included.<br />Consumer onboarding process<br />When you're ready to move to production, request a production API key.",

Get Access Credentials<br />Get started by filling out the form on the Apply for VA Lighthouse Developer Access page.<br />After submitting a request, you will receive your credentials for using the API in the Development environment, which allows you to try it out with mock data before moving to the Production environment.<br />2. Test the API<br />In the endpoint documentation below, we've provided a curl command builder for trying out the API before implementation with your app.<br />Use Test User attributes to populate the request body.<br />3. Build your app<br />The base URI for the Veteran Confirmation API in the Sandbox environment is:<br />https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/veteran_confirmation/v0<br />In this environment, use attributes from the list of Test Users. Only Test Users can return a \"confirmed\" response.<br />Check out some of our sample apps. Please visit our VA Lighthouse Support portal should you need further assistance.<br />4. Show us a demo and get access to the Production environment<br />After building your app, we ask that you give us a demo before we set you up with production credentials. Please see the Path to Production page for more details.<br />Authorization<br />This API requires an API key in combination with identifiable information for the person being confirmed listed below. API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token provided in an HTTP header with name apikey. Including more information has a better chance of making a match and returning a Confirmed status.<br />Required information:<br />First Name<br />Last Name<br />Date of Birth<br />Social Security Number<br />Optional information:<br />Middle Name<br />Gender<br />Reference<br />Sandbox vs. Production Data<br />APIs accessed via the Sandbox environment are using the same underlying logic as VA’s production APIs; only the underlying data store is different.<br />Master Veteran Index (MVI)<br />The Master Veteran Index confirms a user's identity. In Production, several factors are considered to confirm identity. These include: a user’s first name, last name, date of birth and Social Security number. The MVI is mocked in the Sandbox environment. In this environment, the only factor used to confirm identity is the Social Security number.<br />Rate Limiting<br />We implemented basic rate limiting of 60 requests per minute. If you exceed this quota, your request will return a 429 status code.

Information available includes<br />geographic location, address, phone, hours of operation, and available services.<br />VA operates several different types of facilities, the types represented in this API include:<br />Health Facilities (vha)<br />Benefits Facilities (vba)<br />Cemeteries (nca)<br />Vet Centers (vc)<br />To read an FAQ on how wait times are calculated, click the \"For more information\" link on this page.<br />Getting Started<br />Base URLs<br />The base URLs for the VA Facilities API in the various environments are:<br />Sandbox: https://sandbox-api.va.gov/services/va_facilities/v0<br />Production: https://api.va.gov/services/va_facilities/v0<br />Authorization<br />API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name apikey.<br />Response Formats<br />Clients may request several response formats by setting the Accept header.<br />application/json - The default JSON response format complies with JSON API. This media type is not available for bulk requests using the /facilities/all endpoint. It will return 406 Not Acceptable.<br />application/geo+json - GeoJSON-compliant format, representing each facility as a feature with a point geometry.<br />application/vnd.geo+json - Deprecated. Prefer application/geo+json.<br />text/csv - Available for the bulk download operation only. Some structured fields are omitted from the CSV response.<br />Response Elements<br />Some data elements within the response are only present for facilities of a given type:<br />The patient satisfaction scores contained in the satisfaction element are only applicable<br /> to VA health facilities.<br />The patient wait time values contained in the wait_times element are only applicable to<br /> VA health facilities.<br />The list of available services in the services element is only applicable to VA health and<br /> benefits facilities.<br />The operational hours special instructions contained in the operationalhoursspecial_instructions element is only applicable to VA health and Vet Center facilities.<br />Facility ID Formats and Constraints<br />A facility ID has the format prefix_stationNumber. The prefix is one of nca, vc, vba, or vha. Cemeteries may be national (VA) or non-national; non-national cemeteries have the station number prefixed with an s. There are no other constraints on the format. Examples:<br />Health: vha_402GA<br />Benefits: vba_539GB<br />National cemetery: nca_063<br />Non-national cemetery: nca_s1082<br />Vet center: vc_0872MVC<br />Mobile Facilities<br />The mobile health facilities move regularly within a region. If a facility comes back from this API with \"mobile\": \"true\", the latitude/longitude and address could be inaccurate.

      "description": "Use the VA Forms API to search for VA forms, get the form's PDF link and metadata, and check for new versions.<br />Visit our VA Lighthouse Contact Us page for further assistance.<br />Background<br />This API offers an efficient way to stay up-to-date with the latest VA forms and information. The forms information listed on VA.gov matches the information returned by this API.<br />Search by form number, keyword, or title<br />Get a link to the form in PDF format<br />Get detailed form metadata including the number of pages, related forms, benefit categories, language, and more<br />Retrieve the latest date of PDF changes and the SHA256 checksum<br />Identify when a form is deleted by the VA<br />Technical summary<br />The VA Forms API collects form data from the official VA Form Repository on a nightly basis. The Index endpoint can return all available forms or, if an optional query parameter is passed, will return only forms that may relate to the query value. When a valid form name is passed to the Show endpoint, it will return a single form with additional metadata and full revision history. A JSON response is given with the PDF link (if published) and the corresponding form metadata.<br />Authentication and authorization<br />The form information shared by this API is publicly available. API requests are authorized through a symmetric API token, provided in an HTTP header with name apikey. Get a sandbox API Key.<br />Testing in sandbox environment<br />Form data in the sandbox environment is for testing your API only, and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date. This API also has a reduced API rate limit. When you're ready to move to production, be sure to request a production API key.<br />SHA256 revision history<br />Each form is checked nightly for recent file changes. A corresponding SHA256 checksum is calculated, which provides a record of when the PDF changed and the SHA256 hash that was calculated. This allows end users to know that they have the most recent version and can verify the integrity of a previously downloaded PDF.<br />Valid PDF link<br />Additionally, during the nightly refresh process, the link to the form PDF is verified and the valid_pdf metadata is updated accordingly. If marked true, the link is valid and is a current form. If marked false, the link is either broken or the form has been removed.<br />Deleted forms<br />If the deleted_at metadata is set, that means the VA has removed this form from the repository and it is no longer to be used.",

      "description": "Terms and Definitions<br />Throughout this document and the Velo platform the following terms are used:<br />Payor. An entity (typically a corporation) which wishes to pay funds to one or more payees via a payout.<br />Payee. The recipient of funds paid out by a payor.<br />Payment. A single transfer of funds from a payor to a payee.<br />Payout. A batch of Payments, typically used by a payor to logically group payments (e.g. by business day). Technically there need be no relationship between the payments in a payout - a single payout can contain payments to multiple payees and/or multiple payments to a single payee.<br />Sandbox. An integration environment provided by Velo Payments which offers a similar API experience to the production environment, but all funding and payment events are simulated, along with many other services such as OFAC sanctions list checking.<br />Overview<br />The Velo Payments API allows a payor to perform a number of operations. The following is a list of the main capabilities in a natural order of execution:<br />Authenticate with the Velo platform<br />Maintain a collection of payees<br />Query the payor’s current balance of funds within the platform and perform additional funding<br />Issue payments to payees<br />Query the platform for a history of those payments<br />This document describes the main concepts and APIs required to get up and running with the Velo Payments platform. It is not an exhaustive API reference. For that, please see the separate Velo Payments API Reference.<br />API Considerations<br />The Velo Payments API is REST based and uses the JSON format for requests and responses.<br />Most calls are secured using OAuth 2 security and require a valid authentication access token for successful operation. See the Authentication section for details.<br />Where a dynamic value is required in the examples below, the {token} format is used, suggesting that the caller needs to supply the appropriate value of the token in question (without including the { or } characters).<br />Where curl examples are given, the –d @filename.json approach is used, indicating that the request body should be placed into a file named filename.json in the current directory. Each of the curl examples in this document should be considered a single line on the command-line, regardless of how they appear in print.<br />Authenticating with the Velo Platform<br />Once Velo backoffice staff have added your organization as a payor within the Velo platform sandbox, they will create you a payor Id, an API key and an API secret and share these with you in a secure manner.<br />You will need to use these values to authenticate with the Velo platform in order to gain access to the APIs. The steps to take are explained in the following:<br />create a string comprising the API key (e.g. 44a9537d-d55d-4b47-8082-14061c2bcdd8) and API secret (e.g. c396b26b-137a-44fd-87f5-34631f8fd529) with a colon between them. E.g. 44a9537d-d55d-4b47-8082-14061c2bcdd8:c396b26b-137a-44fd-87f5-34631f8fd529<br />base64 encode this string. E.g.: NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==<br />create an HTTP Authorization header with the value set to e.g. Basic NDRhOTUzN2QtZDU1ZC00YjQ3LTgwODItMTQwNjFjMmJjZGQ4OmMzOTZiMjZiLTEzN2EtNDRmZC04N2Y1LTM0NjMxZjhmZDUyOQ==<br />perform the Velo authentication REST call using the HTTP header created above e.g. via curl:<br />If you make other Velo API calls which require authorization but the Authorization header is missing or invalid then you will get a 401 HTTP status response.",

To authenticate, you’ll need to supply a sportsbook username and password, in return you will be given an authentication ticket, which you can use on the majority of requests found within our services. The Sessions API should be used whenever you want to login a customer and: continue to use the William Hill API for that customer’s transactions use other CAS-enabled William Hill services outside the suite of APIs CAS is an enterprise Single Sign-On solution for web services (see https://wiki.jasig.org/display/CAS/Home). It is used by many William Hill services. Note: all requests must be executed over HTTPS and include an API key and secret. Authentication Ticket Expiration Times When a customer is logged in using the Sessions API, they are given an Authentication Ticket; using this ticket on subsequent API requests gives you access to account activities (such as placing a bet, deposits, etc). However, this ticket is only valid for a given period of time depending on how it is used. If the ticket is used and then has a period of inactivity longer than 7,200 seconds (2 hours), then the ticket will expire and further requests using the ticket will be denied - in effect, a customer has been logged out and will need to authenticate again. Normally, any ticket issued only has a maximum life expectancy of 28,000 seconds (8 hours) after which it can no longer be used, even if it has been used regularly. The customer again will be effectively logged out and will need to authenticate again. If you wish to avoid this, you need to set the query parameter extended to Y, which will enable your application to generate a ticket valid for 60 days without expiring due to inactivity.",

      "description": "About the REST API<br />The Wowza Streaming Cloud TM REST API (application programming interface) offers complete programmatic control over live streams, transcoders, stream sources, and stream targets. Anything you can do in the Wowza Streaming Cloud UI can also be achieved by making HTTP-based requests to cloud-based servers through the REST API.<br />The Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API features cross-origin resource sharing, or CORS.<br />CORS is a W3C specification that provides headers in HTTP requests to enable a web server to safely make a network request to another domain.<br />In order to protect shared resources, the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API is subject to limits. For details, see Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API limits.<br />About this documentation<br />This reference documentation is based on the open-source Swagger framework.<br />It allows you to view the operations, parameters, and request and reponse schemas for every resource. Request samples are presented in cURL (Shell) and JavaScript; some samples also include just the JSON object. Response samples are all JSON.<br />For more information and examples on using the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API, see our library of Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API technical articles.<br />Query requirements<br />The Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API uses HTTP requests to retrieve data from cloud-based servers. Requests must contain proper JSON, two authentication keys, and the correct version number in the base path.<br />JSON<br />The Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API uses the JSON API specification to request and return data. This means requests must include the header Content-Type: application/json and must include a single resource object in JSON format as primary data.<br />Responses include HTTP status codes that indicate whether the query was successful. If there was an error, a description explains the problem so that you can fix it and try again.<br />Authentication<br />Requests to the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API must be authenticated with two keys: an API key and an access key. Each key is a 64-character alphanumeric string that you can find on the API Access page in Wowza Streaming Cloud.<br />Use the wsc-api-key and wsc-access-key headers to authenticate requests, like this (in cURL):<br />",

See REST endpoint base URL of Production Copy (Service) Environment for existing and new customers for more information. |<br />|US Cloud Production | https://rest.na.zuora.com |<br />|US Cloud API Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.na.zuora.com |<br />|US Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.zuora.com |<br />|EU Production | https://rest.eu.zuora.com |<br />|EU API Sandbox | https://rest.sandbox.eu.zuora.com |<br />|EU Central Sandbox | https://rest.test.eu.zuora.com |<br />The Production endpoint provides access to your live user data. Sandbox tenants are a good place to test code without affecting real-world data. If you would like Zuora to provision a Sandbox tenant for you, contact your Zuora representative for assistance.<br />If you do not have a Zuora tenant, go to https://www.zuora.com/resource/zuora-test-drive and sign up for a Production Test Drive tenant. The tenant comes with seed data, including a sample product catalog.<br />API Changelog<br />You can find the Changelog of the API Reference: Billing in the Zuora Community.<br />Authentication<br />OAuth v2.0<br />Zuora recommends that you use OAuth v2.0 to authenticate to the Zuora REST API. Currently, OAuth is not available in every environment. See Zuora Testing Environments for more information.<br />Zuora recommends you to create a dedicated API user with API write access on a tenant when authenticating via OAuth, and then create an OAuth client for this user. See Create an API User for how to do this. By creating a dedicated API user, you can control permissions of the API user without affecting other non-API users.<br />If a user is deactivated, all of the user's OAuth clients will be automatically deactivated.<br />Authenticating via OAuth requires the following steps:<br />Create a Client<br />Generate a Token<br />Make Authenticated Requests<br />Create a Client<br />You must first create an OAuth client in the Zuora UI. To do this, you must be an administrator of your Zuora tenant. This is a one-time operation. You will be provided with a Client ID and a Client Secret. Please note this information down, as it will be required for the next step.<br />Note: The OAuth client will be owned by a Zuora user account. If you want to perform PUT, POST, or DELETE operations using the OAuth client, the owner of the OAuth client must have a Platform role that includes the \"API Write Access\" permission.<br />Generate a Token<br />After creating a client, you must make a call to obtain a bearer token using the Generate an OAuth token operation. This operation requires the following parameters:<br />client_id - the Client ID displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step<br />client_secret - the Client Secret displayed when you created the OAuth client in the previous step<br />granttype - must be set to clientcredentials<br />Note: The Client ID and Client Secret mentioned above were displayed when you created the OAuth Client in the prior step. The Generate an OAuth token response specifies how long the bearer token is valid for. You should reuse the bearer token until it is expired. When the token is expired, call Generate an OAuth token again to generate a new one.<br />Make Authenticated Requests<br />To authenticate subsequent API requests, you must provide a valid bearer token in an HTTP header:<br />Authorization: Bearer {bearer_token}<br />If you have Zuora Multi-entity enabled, you need to set an additional header to specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. You can use the scope field in the Generate an OAuth token response to determine whether you need to specify an entity ID.<br />If the scope field contains more than one entity ID, you must specify the ID of the entity that you want to access. For example, if the scope field contains entity.1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc and entity.c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9, specify one of the following headers:<br />Zuora-Entity-Ids: 1a2b7a37-3e7d-4cb3-b0e2-883de9e766cc<br />Zuora-Entity-Ids: c92ed977-510c-4c48-9b51-8d5e848671e9<br />Note: For a limited period of time, Zuora will accept the entityId header as an alternative to the Zuora-Entity-Ids header. If you choose to set the entityId header, you must remove all \"-\" characters from the entity ID in the scope field.<br />If the scope field contains a single entity ID, you do not need to specify an entity ID.<br />Other Supported Authentication Schemes<br />Zuora continues to support the following additional legacy means of authentication:<br /> Use username and password. Include authentication with each request in the header:<br /> apiAccessKeyId<br /> apiSecretAccessKey<br /> Zuora recommends that you create an API user specifically for making API calls. See Create an API User for more information.<br /> Use an authorization cookie. The cookie authorizes the user to make calls to the REST API for the duration specified in Administration > Security Policies > Session timeout. The cookie expiration time is reset with this duration after every call to the REST API. To obtain a cookie, call the Connections resource with the following API user information:<br /> ID<br /> Password<br /> For CORS-enabled APIs only: Include a 'single-use' token in the request header, which re-authenticates the user with each request. See below for more details.<br />Entity Id and Entity Name<br />The entityId and entityName parameters are only used for Zuora Multi-entity. These are the legacy parameters that Zuora will only continue to support for a period of time. Zuora recommends you to use the Zuora-Entity-Ids parameter instead.<br />The entityId and entityName parameters specify the Id and the name of the entity that you want to access, respectively. Note that you must have permission to access the entity.<br />You can specify either the entityId or entityName parameter in the authentication to access and view an entity.<br /> If both entityId and entityName are specified in the authentication, an error occurs.<br /> If neither entityId nor entityName is specified in the authentication, you will log in to the entity in which your user account is created.<br />To get the entity Id and entity name, you can use the GET Entities REST call. For more information, see API User Authentication.<br />Token Authentication for CORS-Enabled APIs<br /> The CORS mechanism enables REST API calls to Zuora to be made directly from your customer's browser, with all credit card and security information transmitted directly to Zuora. This minimizes your PCI compliance burden, allows you to implement advanced validation on your payment forms, and makes your payment forms look just like any other part of your website.<br />For security reasons, instead of using cookies, an API request via CORS uses tokens for authentication.<br />The token method of authentication is only designed for use with requests that must originate from your customer's browser; it should not be considered a replacement to the existing cookie authentication mechanism.<br />See Zuora CORS REST for details on how CORS works and how you can begin to implement customer calls to the Zuora REST APIs. See HMAC Signatures for details on the HMAC method that returns the authentication token.<br />Requests and Responses<br />Request IDs<br />As a general rule, when asked to supply a \"key\" for an account or subscription (accountKey, account-key, subscriptionKey, subscription-key), you can provide either the actual ID or the number of the entity.<br />HTTP Request Body<br />Most of the parameters and data accompanying your requests will be contained in the body of the HTTP request.<br />The Zuora REST API accepts JSON in the HTTP request body. No other data format (e.g., XML) is supported.<br />Data Type<br />(Actions and CRUD operations only) We recommend that you do not specify the decimal values with quotation marks, commas, and spaces. Use characters of +-0-9.eE, for example, 5, 1.9, -8.469, and 7.7e2. Also, Zuora does not convert currencies for decimal values.<br />Testing a Request<br />Use a third party client, such as curl, Postman, or Advanced REST Client, to test the Zuora REST API.<br />You can test the Zuora REST API from the Zuora API Sandbox or Production tenants. If connecting to Production, bear in mind that you are working with your live production data, not sample data or test data.<br />Testing with Credit Cards<br />Sooner or later it will probably be necessary to test some transactions that involve credit cards. For suggestions on how to handle this, see [Going Live With Your Payment Gateway](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CBBilling/MPaymentGateways/CManagingPaymentGateways/BGoingLivePaymentGateways#TestingwithCreditCards \"CZuoraUserGuides/ABillingandPayments/MPaymentGateways/CManagingPaymentGateways/BGoingLivePaymentGateways#TestingwithCredit_Cards\"<br />).<br />Concurrent Request Limits<br />Zuora enforces tenant-level concurrent request limits. See Concurrent Request Limits for more information.<br />Timeout Limit<br />If a request does not complete within 120 seconds, the request times out and Zuora returns a Gateway Timeout error.<br />Error Handling<br />If a request to Zuora Billing REST API with an endpoint starting with /v1 (except Actions and CRUD operations) fails, the response will contain an eight-digit error code with a corresponding error message to indicate the details of the error.<br />The following code snippet is a sample error response that contains an error code and message pair:<br />The success field indicates whether the API request has succeeded. The processId field is a Zuora internal ID that you can provide to Zuora Global Support for troubleshooting purposes.<br />The reasons field contains the actual error code and message pair. The error code begins with 5 or 6 means that you encountered a certain issue that is specific to a REST API resource in Zuora Billing. For example, 53100320 indicates that an invalid value is specified for the termType field of the subscription object.<br />The error code beginning with 9 usually indicates that an authentication-related issue occurred, and it can also indicate other unexpected errors depending on different cases. For example, 90000011 indicates that an invalid credential is provided in the request header.<br />When troubleshooting the error, you can divide the error code into two components: REST API resource code and error category code. See the following Zuora error code sample:<br />Note: Zuora determines resource codes based on the request payload. Therefore, if GET and DELETE requests that do not contain payloads fail, you will get 500000 as the resource code, which indicates an unknown object and an unknown field.<br />The error category code of these requests is valid and follows the rules described in the Error Category Code section.<br />In such case, you can refer to the returned error message to troubleshoot.<br />REST API Resource Code<br />The 6-digit resource code indicates the REST API resource, typically a field of a Zuora object, on which the issue occurs. In the preceding example, 531003 refers to the termType field of the subscription object.<br />The value range for all REST API resource codes is from 500000 to 679999. See Resource Codes in the Knowledge Center for a full list of resource codes.<br />Error Category Code<br />The 2-digit error category code identifies the type of error, for example, resource not found or missing required field.<br />The following table describes all error categories and the corresponding resolution:<br />| Code | Error category | Description | Resolution |<br />|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|<br />| 10 | Permission or access denied | The request cannot be processed because a certain tenant or user permission is missing. | Check the missing tenant or user permission in the response message and contact Zuora Global Support for enablement. |<br />| 11 | Authentication failed | Authentication fails due to invalid API authentication credentials. | Ensure that a valid API credential is specified. |<br />| 20 | Invalid format or value | The request cannot be processed due to an invalid field format or value. | Check the invalid field in the error message, and ensure that the format and value of all fields you passed in are valid. |<br />| 21 | Unknown field in request | The request cannot be processed because an unknown field exists in the request body. | Check the unknown field name in the response message, and ensure that you do not include any unknown field in the request body. |<br />| 22 | Missing required field | The request cannot be processed because a required field in the request body is missing. | Check the missing field name in the response message, and ensure that you include all required fields in the request body. |<br />| 30 | Rule restriction | The request cannot be processed due to the violation of a Zuora business rule. | Check the response message and ensure that the API request meets the specified business rules. |<br />| 40 | Not found | The specified resource cannot be found. | Check the response message and ensure that the specified resource exists in your Zuora tenant. |<br />| 45 | Unsupported request | The requested endpoint does not support the specified HTTP method. | Check your request and ensure that the endpoint and method matches. |<br />| 50 | Locking contention | This request cannot be processed because the objects this request is trying to modify are being modified by another API request, UI operation, or batch job process. | Resubmit the request first to have another try. If this error still occurs, contact Zuora Global Support with the returned Zuora-Request-Id value in the response header for assistance. |<br />| 60 | Internal error | The server encounters an internal error. | Contact Zuora Global Support with the returned Zuora-Request-Id value in the response header for assistance. |<br />| 70 | Request exceeded limit | The total number of concurrent requests exceeds the limit allowed by the system. | Resubmit the request after the number of seconds specified by the Retry-After value in the response header. Check Concurrent request limits for details about Zuora’s concurrent request limit policy. |<br />| 90 | Malformed request | The request cannot be processed due to JSON syntax errors. | Check the syntax error in the JSON request body and ensure that the request is in the correct JSON format. |<br />| 99 | Integration error | The server encounters an error when communicating with an external system, for example, payment gateway, tax engine provider. | Check the response message and take action accordingly. |<br />Pagination<br />When retrieving information (using GET methods), the optional pageSize query parameter sets the maximum number of rows to return in a response. The maximum is 40; larger values are treated as 40. If this value is empty or invalid, pageSize typically defaults to 10.<br />The default value for the maximum number of rows retrieved can be overridden at the method level.<br />If more rows are available, the response will include a nextPage element, which contains a URL for requesting the next page. If this value is not provided, no more rows are available. No \"previous page\" element is explicitly provided; to support backward paging, use the previous call.<br />Array Size<br />For data items that are not paginated, the REST API supports arrays of up to 300 rows. Thus, for instance, repeated pagination can retrieve thousands of customer accounts, but within any account an array of no more than 300 rate plans is returned.<br />API Versions<br />The Zuora REST API are version controlled. Versioning ensures that Zuora REST API changes are backward compatible. Zuora uses a major and minor version nomenclature to manage changes. By specifying a version in a REST request, you can get expected responses regardless of future changes to the API.<br />Major Version<br />The major version number of the REST API appears in the REST URL. Currently, Zuora only supports the v1 major version. For example, POST https://rest.zuora.com/v1/subscriptions.<br />Minor Version<br />Zuora uses minor versions for the REST API to control small changes. For example, a field in a REST method is deprecated and a new field is used to replace it.<br />Some fields in the REST methods are supported as of minor versions. If a field is not noted with a minor version, this field is available for all minor versions. If a field is noted with a minor version, this field is in version control. You must specify the supported minor version in the request header to process without an error.<br />If a field is in version control, it is either with a minimum minor version or a maximum minor version, or both of them. You can only use this field with the minor version between the minimum and the maximum minor versions. For example, the invoiceCollect field in the POST Subscription method is in version control and its maximum minor version is 189.0. You can only use this field with the minor version 189.0 or earlier.<br />If you specify a version number in the request header that is not supported, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API. In our REST API documentation, if a field or feature requires a minor version number, we note that in the field description.<br />You only need to specify the version number when you use the fields require a minor version. To specify the minor version, set the zuora-version parameter to the minor version number in the request header for the request call. For example, the collect field is in 196.0 minor version. If you want to use this field for the POST Subscription method, set the zuora-version parameter to 196.0 in the request header. The zuora-version parameter is case sensitive.<br />For all the REST API fields, by default, if the minor version is not specified in the request header, Zuora will use the minimum minor version of the REST API to avoid breaking your integration.<br />Minor Version History<br />The supported minor versions are not serial. This section documents the changes made to each Zuora REST API minor version.<br />The following table lists the supported versions and the fields that have a Zuora REST API minor version.<br />| Fields | Minor Version | REST Methods | Description |<br />|:--------|:--------|:--------|:--------|<br />| invoiceCollect | 189.0 and earlier | Create Subscription; Update Subscription; Renew Subscription; Cancel Subscription; Suspend Subscription; Resume Subscription; Create Account|Generates an invoice and collects a payment for a subscription. |<br />| collect | 196.0 and later | Create Subscription; Update Subscription; Renew Subscription; Cancel Subscription; Suspend Subscription; Resume Subscription; Create Account|Collects an automatic payment for a subscription. |<br />| invoice | 196.0 and 207.0| Create Subscription; Update Subscription; Renew Subscription; Cancel Subscription; Suspend Subscription; Resume Subscription; Create Account|Generates an invoice for a subscription. |<br />| invoiceTargetDate | 196.0 and earlier | Preview Subscription |Date through which charges are calculated on the invoice, as yyyy-mm-dd. |<br />| invoiceTargetDate | 207.0 and earlier | Create Subscription; Update Subscription; Renew Subscription; Cancel Subscription; Suspend Subscription; Resume Subscription; Create Account|Date through which charges are calculated on the invoice, as yyyy-mm-dd. |<br />| targetDate | 207.0 and later | Preview Subscription |Date through which charges are calculated on the invoice, as yyyy-mm-dd. |<br />| targetDate | 211.0 and later | Create Subscription; Update Subscription; Renew Subscription; Cancel Subscription; Suspend Subscription; Resume Subscription; Create Account|Date through which charges are calculated on the invoice, as yyyy-mm-dd. |<br />| includeExisting DraftInvoiceItems | 196.0 and earlier| Preview Subscription; Update Subscription | Specifies whether to include draft invoice items in subscription previews.
